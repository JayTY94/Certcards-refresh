You can create teams in Staff Manager that mirror the working groups, departments, reporting relationships, or other groupings used in your firm.

Grids are used to list and access items, such as clients and staff. Grid data can be manipulated in various ways. Some of the behaviors for managing grid data, such as Print, Export, and Find, follow Microsoft® standards. Additional grid components exist on the ribbon, right-click menu, and in the grid itself.







7
CCH Axcess
The Export Grid option exports up to 20,000 records from all pages of the Client Manager Quick Search results. For the Staff Manager Quick Search, only the current page of results are exported with this option. 

That behavior seems really inconsistent to me.

Providing Access Through Staff Attributes
Granting access by organizational unit or position allows for less maintenance, but gives less precise control. Including or excluding some staff in various groups may be required. An advantage of granting access through attributes is that new staff or staff whose attributes change are automatically granted access according to their organizational unit or position.
