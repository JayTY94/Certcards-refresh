What is Bandwidth and how does it differ from Throughput?

Bandwidth: The maximum rate of data transfer across a network path, typically measured in Mbps or Gbps. It represents the network's capacity.
Throughput: The actual rate of successful data transfer achieved, often lower than the bandwidth due to factors like network congestion and protocol overhead.
