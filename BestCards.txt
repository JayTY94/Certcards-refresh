Identifier Alignment

Ensuring that the domains used in SPF and DKIM authentication align with the domain in the email's "From" header.
Critical for DMARC to function correctly.
Can be achieved through relaxed alignment (subdomains are allowed) or strict alignment (exact match required).

What is Bandwidth and how does it differ from Throughput?

Bandwidth: The maximum rate of data transfer across a network path, typically measured in Mbps or Gbps. It represents the network's capacity.
Throughput: The actual rate of successful data transfer achieved, often lower than the bandwidth due to factors like network congestion and protocol overhead.



=============
SRV (Service) Records
DNS records that specify the location (hostname and port) of servers for particular services within a domain. Essential for services like SIP (VoIP) or LDAP, they enable clients to discover service endpoints automatically.





=============
How does TimedRotatingFileHandler from the logging.handlers module differ from RotatingFileHandler?

TimedRotatingFileHandler rotates log files based on time intervals (e.g., daily at midnight), whereas RotatingFileHandler rotates based on file size (maxBytes).







=============
A Firewall Policy is the recommended method to configure your Azure Firewall. It's a global resource that can be used across multiple Azure Firewall instance in Secured Virtual Hubs and Hub Virtual Networks. Polciies will work across regions and subscriptions.






=============
What is the maximum supported size of a VHDX file in FSLogix?
VHDX files can support up to 64 TB, making them suitable for large-scale enterprise environments where user profiles may require substantial storage capacity.







=============
If a virus never saves itself to a storage drive, it may be able to evade antivirus software. Instead of existing as a file that might execute, the fileless virus operates soley in the memory of the comptuer. Once it's sarted, all operations happen inside of RAM.






=============
Password Spraying is where the attacker obtains the account names of individuals (like from the company's website) and then uses the same common passwords to try to authenticate to each of them.






=============
802.11 management frames 
    Communication that makes WiFi work
    How devices find APs, managed QoS, associate, and disassociate with an AP 
Original wireless standards did not add protection for management frames 
    Sent in clear, no authentication or validation






=============
Diffusion means that if we change a single bit of the plaintext, then about half of the bits in the cyphertext should change, and similarly, if we change one bit of the cyphertext, then about half of the plaintext bits should change.
