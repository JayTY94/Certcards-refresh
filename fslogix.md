Multi-Session Windows 10/11:
A version of Windows optimized for AVD that supports multiple concurrent user sessions on a single VM, combining the cost efficiency of RDS with the user experience of a Windows desktop.

FS Logix:
A suite of tools designed to optimize user profile management and application performance in virtual desktop and remote desktop environments. It includes components such as Profile Containers, Office Containers, Application Masking, and Cloud Cache.

Profile Container:
A core FS Logix component that encapsulates the entire user profile in a VHD/VHDX file. This approach improves logon/logoff times and reduces issues associated with traditional roaming profiles by loading a single container instead of numerous individual files.

Office Container:
A specialized FS Logix component that isolates and caches Office 365 data (most notably Outlook OST files) in its own container. By offloading this dynamic, frequently changing data from the main profile, it significantly improves performance and reduces logon delays.

Outlook OST Files:
Offline Storage Table files used by Microsoft Outlook to store a synchronized copy of mailbox data locally. They enable offline access to email, calendar, and contact data. Managing these files in an Office Container prevents them from bloating the main user profile.

Redirector Driver:
A mechanism within FS Logix that intercepts and reroutes file system I/O operations aimed at profile containers. It helps mitigate file locking issues—especially in multi-session environments—by ensuring controlled access to VHD/VHDX files.

Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI):
A technology where each user is provided with a dedicated virtual machine running its own instance of the operating system. VDI offers strong isolation and personalization but often requires more resources and higher infrastructure costs.

Remote Desktop Services (RDS):
A session-based technology where multiple users share a single server or a pool of servers. RDS provides centralized management and efficient resource sharing, although performance can vary with heavy concurrent usage.

VHD/VHDX:
Virtual hard disk file formats used by FS Logix Profile Containers to store user profiles. They are optimized for efficient I/O operations and are crucial for fast loading times in virtual environments.

Multi-Session Environment:
A setup where multiple users share the same operating system instance (typical of RDS and multi-session AVD deployments). This environment requires special considerations—such as the use of a Redirector Driver—to handle concurrent access and prevent file locking issues.

Storage Type (SMB vs. Local Disk):
The selection of storage options for hosting Profile Containers. In AVD, using an SMB share (such as Azure Files) is generally recommended over local disks, as it can provide better performance and reliability in a distributed cloud environment.

SMB Share (Server Message Block):
A network file-sharing protocol used in Windows environments. SMB shares, like those provided by Azure Files, are commonly used for storing FS Logix Profile Containers, ensuring centralized and efficient access.

Dynamic Scaling:
A key feature of AVD that automatically adjusts the number of session hosts in a host pool based on user demand, optimizing resource utilization and cost.

Load Balancing:
The process of distributing user sessions across multiple session hosts within a host pool to prevent any single host from becoming a bottleneck and to ensure a consistent user experience.

FS Logix Cloud Cache:
A caching mechanism within FS Logix that stores user profile data in the cloud. This improves redundancy and performance by ensuring that profiles remain available even if primary storage becomes inaccessible.

FS Logix Application Masking:
A component of FS Logix used to control application visibility. It isolates and hides applications (and their dependencies) from users who should not access them, based on group policies, thereby simplifying desktop environments.

FSLogix Agent Log:
A log file generated by the FS Logix agent that provides detailed diagnostic information. It is crucial for troubleshooting issues related to mounting Profile Containers and other FS Logix operations.

Antivirus Software Exclusions for FS Logix Container Files:
A best practice in FS Logix deployments. It involves configuring antivirus software to exclude FS Logix container files (both Profile and Office Containers stored in VHD/VHDX format) from scanning. This prevents potential performance degradation and issues during file access.
