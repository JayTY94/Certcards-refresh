=============
cloud-init
A cloud instance initialization system used to automatically configure virtual machines on first boot. It allows provisioning tasks like installing packages, setting up users, and running custom scripts, commonly used with tools like Terraform on platforms like Azure.

=============
Terraform cloud-init template (cloud-init.yaml.tpl)
A parameterized file used in Terraform deployments to define and inject cloud-init configuration into a virtual machine. The .tpl extension signifies that it's processed by Terraform’s templatefile() function to fill in variables like tokens or storage names.

=============
Corepack
A Node.js feature introduced in v16.9+ (stable in v18+) that enables and manages alternative package managers like pnpm or yarn. It allows these tools to be used without global installation, based on what's specified in a project’s configuration.

=============
pnpm (Performant npm)
A fast, disk-efficient Node.js package manager that uses a content-addressable store to avoid duplicating dependencies. It is stricter than npm in enforcing dependency rules, and it significantly reduces install time and disk usage.

=============
VS Code Server (Remote - SSH)
A background process installed automatically when using VS Code Remote SSH. It runs on the remote machine to handle code editing, extensions, and debugging, effectively turning the remote system into a headless VS Code environment.

=============
Azure Standard_B1s VM
An entry-level VM size with 1 vCPU and 1 GB RAM, suitable for low-resource tasks. Often used for testing or lightweight dev environments, but insufficient for running modern tooling like VS Code Server and Node.js setup simultaneously.

=============
Swap File on Linux
A file on disk used as overflow memory when RAM is full. Adding a swap file allows small VMs (like B1s) to avoid crashing under memory pressure, especially during heavy operations like package installations.

=============
Snap (Snapd)
A cross-distro package system developed by Canonical. Snap packages are self-contained and automatically updated. Snapd is the background service that manages snaps, but it can be memory-heavy during startup and initialization.

=============
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
A command that downloads and prepares the latest version of pnpm through Corepack, making it available globally on the system without needing a manual install via npm -g.

=============
Auto-shutdown in Azure
A VM feature (configurable via the portal or DevTest Labs resources) that automatically powers off the VM at a scheduled time to prevent cost overrun. It’s especially useful for dev/test environments that aren’t always in use.

You said:
no, can you do more terms?


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — here’s a second batch of vocabulary terms based on the rest of our conversation. These cover more of the tooling, processes, and Azure-specific elements we've touched on:

=============
corepack enable
A command that activates Corepack globally on your system, allowing it to manage alternative Node.js package managers (like pnpm or yarn) using project-defined configuration.

=============
exercism configure
A CLI command used to link the Exercism CLI to your account. It sets your API token and optionally configures your local workspace directory, so you can download and submit coding exercises.

=============
CIFS (Common Internet File System)
A network file-sharing protocol used by Windows and supported on Linux via cifs-utils. It's used in Azure File Shares to mount a remote storage directory into a Linux VM as if it were a local folder.

=============
Azure File Share Mount in Linux
A process that connects a VM to an Azure Files storage account using the CIFS protocol. It's commonly mounted at boot time using cloud-init and allows persistence across VM reboots or tear-downs.

=============
tar -xzf
A Unix command to extract .tar.gz (gzip-compressed tarballs). The flags mean x (extract), z (decompress), and f (use file). Commonly used to install binary packages like the Exercism CLI.

=============
curl -L -o filename
A command to download files over HTTP. The -L flag tells curl to follow redirects, and -o filename specifies a custom filename for the output, useful for scripting repeatable installs.

=============
Azure VM SKU (Size)
Defines the virtual machine's CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity in Azure. Examples include Standard_B1s, Standard_B2s, etc. Choosing the right SKU balances performance and cost.

=============
Out of Memory (OOM) condition
Occurs when a VM exceeds its allocated RAM and has no swap space, potentially leading to process termination or a system hang. Common on small instances when running memory-heavy operations.

=============
corepack pnpm test
A command pattern used to run tests in Exercism JavaScript exercises. It runs pnpm test through Corepack to ensure the correct version of pnpm is used without a global install.

=============
Terraform custom_data for cloud-init
A base64-encoded YAML string passed into a VM resource in Terraform. It feeds cloud-init configuration at boot time, allowing VM provisioning and automation through Infrastructure-as-Code.

Let me know if you'd like a third round focused more on VS Code Remote, GitHub CLI use, or Azure CLI commands!

extend to related linux concepts


ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — here’s a third batch focused on Linux-related concepts that connect to what we've discussed. These will help solidify your understanding of what’s happening under the hood in your dev box and automation scripts.

=============
/usr/local/bin
A standard directory in Unix-like systems for storing user-installed executable binaries. It’s typically in the system’s PATH, making anything you move there globally accessible from the command line.

=============
/tmp directory
A temporary directory used for short-lived files. It's often cleared on reboot and used by installers, compilers, or cloud-init scripts to stage downloads and extracted files before moving them to permanent locations.

=============
Shebang (#!/bin/bash)
The first line in many shell scripts, it tells the system which interpreter to use (e.g., bash). Required in cloud-init scripts if you’re writing inline scripts to ensure consistent behavior.

=============
chmod 600
A command that sets file permissions to read/write for the owner only. Commonly used on sensitive files like SSH keys or swapfiles to prevent unauthorized access.

=============
fallocate -l
A Linux command used to create a file of a specified size efficiently without actually writing data. Used to quickly set up a swap file or allocate disk space for testing.

=============
swapon / mkswap
mkswap formats a file to be used as swap space. swapon activates it, allowing the system to treat it like virtual memory. Useful on VMs with low RAM to avoid crashing during memory spikes.

=============
Systemd unit files (*.service)
Configuration files that define how a service should start, stop, and behave under systemd. Services like snapd, cloud-init, or ssh rely on these for lifecycle management on modern Linux distros.

=============
journalctl
A log viewing tool used to inspect logs generated by systemd services. For example, journalctl -xe shows the latest system events — useful for debugging issues like failed mounts or cloud-init errors.

=============
file command
Used to inspect the type of a file based on its content, not its extension. Helpful when downloading files with tools like curl to check whether a .tar.gz is really a binary or an HTML error page.

=============
Process segmentation fault (Segmentation fault (core dumped))
An error that occurs when a program tries to access memory it shouldn’t. Often caused by running a binary built for the wrong OS or architecture (e.g., FreeBSD binary on Linux).

=============
runuser vs sudo vs su

sudo: Run a command as another user (usually root) with elevated privileges.

su: Switches to another user session entirely.

runuser: Preferred in scripts and cloud-init to run a single command as another user without opening a full session.
