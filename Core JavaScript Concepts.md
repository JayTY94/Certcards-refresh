Core JavaScript Concepts
Variable Declarations (let, const, var): Keywords to declare variables with different scopes and mutability. let and const are block-scoped, while var is function-scoped.

Arrow Functions: Concise syntax for writing functions using =>. They do not have their own this context, making them suitable for callbacks.

Closures: Functions that retain access to their lexical scope even when executed outside their original context, enabling data privacy and function factories.

Promises: Objects representing the eventual completion or failure of asynchronous operations, allowing chaining with .then() and .catch().

Async/Await: Syntax for handling asynchronous operations more readably, allowing async functions to pause execution with await until a Promise resolves.

Event Loop: The mechanism that handles asynchronous callbacks in JavaScript, ensuring non-blocking execution by managing the call stack and callback queue.

Prototype-Based Inheritance: JavaScript's inheritance model where objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype object, enabling dynamic property sharing.

ES6 Classes: Syntactic sugar over JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance, providing a clearer and more familiar syntax for creating objects and handling inheritance.

Destructuring: Syntax for unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables, improving code readability and conciseness.

Spread and Rest Operators (...): Operators that expand elements of arrays or objects (spread) and collect multiple elements into a single array parameter (rest).
