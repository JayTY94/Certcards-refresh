1. Contra-Asset Account
An account that offsets the balance of a related asset account. Example: Accumulated Depreciation reduces Equipment value.

2. Current Ratio
Liquidity ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities. Shows ability to pay short-term obligations.

3. Deferral
Delay recognition of revenue or expense to a later period. Example: prepaid rent (asset) or unearned revenue (liability).

4. Matching Principle
Expenses are recorded in the same period as the revenues they help generate. Example: sales commission tied to December sales is recorded in December, even if paid in January.

5. Allowance Method for Doubtful Accounts
Estimates bad debts in advance by setting up a contra-asset account (Allowance for Doubtful Accounts). Matches bad debt expense with related sales.

6. Materiality
Threshold of significance — small transactions can be treated in a simplified way if they wouldn’t impact decisions.

7. Conservatism Principle
Accountants should avoid overstating assets/income. Recognize potential losses early; don’t recognize gains until realized.

8. Amortization
Systematic allocation of the cost of intangible assets (patents, goodwill) over their useful life.

9. Trial Balance
Internal listing of all account balances at a point in time to confirm total debits = total credits.

10. Chart of Accounts (COA)
The master list of accounts (assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses) used in the general ledger.

11. General Ledger (GL)
Central accounting record where all journal entries are posted, organized by account.

12. Journal Entry
The basic transaction record showing debits and credits across accounts.

13. Statement of Cash Flows
Financial statement reporting cash activity in Operating, Investing, and Financing categories.

14. Audit Trail
Evidence showing how a transaction was recorded, modified, and reported. Critical for compliance and system integrity.

15. Reconciliation
Comparing records from two sources (e.g., general ledger vs. bank statement) to confirm accuracy.

16. Accruals vs. Deferrals

Accruals: record revenue/expenses before cash flow (e.g., accrued wages).

Deferrals: record after cash flow (e.g., prepaid rent, unearned revenue).

17. Depreciation Methods
Different approaches for allocating asset cost: straight-line, declining balance, or units-of-production.

18. Intangible Assets
Non-physical assets with value, such as patents, trademarks, or customer lists.

19. Retained Earnings
The cumulative net income of a company that hasn’t been distributed to shareholders as dividends.

20. Audit vs. Review vs. Compilation
Levels of financial statement assurance:

Audit: highest assurance, with testing and verification.

Review: limited assurance, primarily analytical procedures.

Compilation: no assurance, just presenting data in financial statement format.
