    "393":"Refresh Interval\nThe period following the No-Refresh Interval during which the timestamp on a DNS record can be updated. If a record is refreshed within this interval, it remains active; otherwise, it becomes eligible for scavenging.",
    "394":"TSIG (Transaction SIGnature)\nA security mechanism used to authenticate DNS messages, ensuring that zone transfers and other DNS communications are from trusted sources. TSIG uses shared secret keys and cryptographic signatures to verify the authenticity of DNS transactions.",
    "395":"Active Directory-Integrated Zones\nDNS zones that store their data within the Active Directory database. This integration allows for secure dynamic updates and automatic replication of DNS data across all domain controllers, enhancing security and redundancy.",
    "396":"DNS Forwarders\nDNS servers configured to forward queries they cannot resolve locally to external DNS servers. Forwarders help improve DNS resolution efficiency and reduce latency by directing unresolved queries to designated upstream servers.",
    "397":"Zone Transfers\nThe process of copying DNS zone data from a primary DNS server to secondary DNS servers. Zone transfers ensure DNS data consistency and redundancy across multiple DNS servers, enhancing reliability and load distribution.",
    "398":"Conditional Forwarders vs. DNS Policies\nConditional Forwarders direct specific domain queries to designated DNS servers, while DNS Policies allow for more granular control based on various criteria like client IP ranges. Both enhance DNS management but serve different operational needs.",
    "399":"DNS Manager\nA graphical administrative tool in Windows Server used to manage DNS settings and zones. DNS Manager provides interfaces for creating and modifying DNS records, configuring zone properties, setting up forwarders, and implementing security measures.",
    "400":"DNS Zone Types\nDifferent types of DNS zones include Primary, Secondary, Stub, and Active Directory-Integrated zones. Each type serves distinct roles in DNS management, such as data storage, redundancy, delegation, and integration with directory services.",
    "401":"Dynamic Updates\nA DNS feature that allows DNS records to be automatically updated in response to changes in IP addresses or other network configurations. Dynamic updates simplify DNS management by reducing the need for manual record adjustments.",
    "402":"Group Policy Management for DNS\nUsing Group Policy in Windows to enforce DNS settings and configurations across multiple servers and clients. It enables centralized management of DNS policies, security settings, and zone configurations, ensuring consistency and compliance.",
    "403":"Root Hints\nA list of authoritative DNS servers for the root zone. Root hints are used by DNS servers to initiate recursive queries when resolving domain names, especially when no forwarders are configured.",
    "404":"Forward Lookup Zones\nDNS zones that translate hostnames to IP addresses. They are the most common type of DNS zones, enabling clients to resolve domain names to their corresponding IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.",
    "405":"Reverse Lookup Zones\nDNS zones that translate IP addresses back to hostnames. They are used for reverse DNS lookups, allowing clients to determine the hostname associated with a given IP address, which is useful for troubleshooting and security."
