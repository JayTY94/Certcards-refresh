    "371":"Front: What is a Docker Compose file and what is it used for?\n\nBack: A Docker Compose file (docker-compose.yml) is a YAML file that defines and configures multi-container Docker applications. It specifies the services, networks, and volumes needed for the application, allowing users to start and manage all containers with a single command (docker-compose up).",
    "365":"Front: What command is used to generate a new SSH key pair?\n\nbash\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"",
    "316":"Active Directory-Integrated Zones\nDNS zones that store their data within the Active Directory database. This integration allows for secure dynamic updates and automatic replication of DNS data across all domain controllers, enhancing security and redundancy.",
    "375":"Front: What is Port Forwarding and how is it configured on a router?\n\nBack: Port Forwarding is the process of directing incoming traffic on specific ports from the router to designated devices within the local network. It is configured through the router\u2019s admin interface by specifying the external port, internal IP address, and internal port, enabling services like VPNs, game servers, or web servers to be accessible externally.",
    "366":"Front: Define Reverse Proxy and its common uses.\n\nBack: A Reverse Proxy is a server that sits between client devices and backend servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate server. Common uses include load balancing, caching, SSL termination, and enhancing security by hiding the identities and structures of backend servers.",
    "373":"Front: What is Port Mapping in Docker and why is it important?\n\nBack: Port Mapping in Docker connects a port on the host machine to a port inside a Docker container. It allows external access to services running within containers. For example, mapping host port 80 to container port 80 enables users to access a web server running inside the container via the host's IP address on port 80.",
