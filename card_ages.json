You might think this represents a division or line continuation symbol, but it\u2019s neither. By placing the forward slash special parameter at the end, the documentation is telling you that each parameter passed must be passed by position and not by keyword.",
    "2":"If there are data sources being accessed within the partition, and data flowing in from other partitions, the Firewall loses its ability to be the gatekeeper, since the data flowing in could be leaked to one of the internally accessed data sources without it knowing about it. Thus the Firewall prevents a partition that accesses other partitions from being allowed to directly access any data sources.",
    "3":"The simplest way to use cross-validation is to call the cross_val_score helper function on the estimator and the dataset.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\nclf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=1, random_state=42)\nscores = cross_val_score(clf, X, y, cv=5)\nscores",

    "7":"Access tokens are short lived. Refresh them after they expire to continue accessing resources. You can do so by submitting another POST request to the \/token endpoint. Provide the refresh_token instead of the code. Refresh tokens are valid for all permissions that your client has already received consent for.",

Bayesian inference adjusts prior beliefs about data distribution with observed data, allowing for improved posterior estimates in reverse diffusion steps, enhancing image realism.",
    "10":"Sometimes, old environment paths can linger in the registry or elsewhere in the system\u2019s path cache, causing confusion about which Python executable should be used. Running python -m pip explicitly tells the Python interpreter itself to find the correct pip module, sidestepping any possible confusion from old, broken pip links.",

In diffusion, Gaussian processes model how noise is applied over time, treating noise at each step as a sample from a Gaussian distribution for simplicity.",

If Python was uninstalled and reinstalled in a new location, the link in that launcher may be broken or still pointing to the old installation path, even if the correct paths are in the Path variable. This causes pip alone to fail, as it tries to find the old, non-existent Python.",

    "16":"PyTorch is based on Torch, a framework for doing fast computation that is written in C. Torch has a Lua wrapper for constructing models.\n\nPyTorch wraps the same C back end in a Python interface. But it\u2019s more than just a wrapper. Developers built it from the ground up to make models easy to write for Python programmers.",

    "19":"The purpose of the .__init__() method in a Python class is to initialize instance attributes.\n\nWhen you create an instance of a class, Python automatically calls .__init__() using the same arguments that you\u2019ve passed to the constructor. This method sets up the initial state of the object by assigning values to instance attributes.",
    "20":"Control Over Record Path and Metadata in json_normalize: With json_normalize, you can specify the path to the records you want to normalize using the record_path parameter.

    "24":"When it comes to pre-trained models, TensorFlow Hub steps in with models that you can use right away, like ResNet and MobileNet. You can save time by using these models to recognize patterns or objects in images so you don\u2019t have to start from scratch.",
    "25":"In Power Query Diagnostics, 'Diagnose Step' is more useful for getting an insight into what evaluations are happening up to a single step, which can help you identify, up to that step, what performance is like as well as what parts of your query are being performed locally or remotely.",
    "26":"Neighbors-based classification is computed from a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point: a query point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives within the nearest neighbors of the point.",
    "27":"To customize headers, you pass a dictionary of HTTP headers to get() using the headers parameter. For example, you can change your previous search request to highlight matching search terms in the results by specifying the text-match media type in the Accept header:\n\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\n    \"https:\/\/api.github.com\/search\/repositories\",\n    params={\"q\": '\"real python\"'},\n    headers={\"Accept\": \"application\/vnd.github.text-match+json\"},\n)",

Another choice for workflows is Logic apps that can monitor external events, perform branching logic and invoke functions as a result.",
    "30":"The terraform plan -refresh-only option generates a plan that only refreshes the state without proposing any changes to infrastructure. This is useful for seeing the current state of resources, particularly when changes have been made outside of Terraform, allowing you to compare infrastructure with the configuration.",
    "31":"KFold: KFold splits data into k consecutive folds (typically 5 or 10) for cross-validation, ensuring each fold is used as both a training and validation set. It\u2019s widely used for balanced datasets, providing reliable estimates of a model\u2019s performance on unseen data.",
    "32":"The terraform state command family allows you to manipulate the state file directly. Commands like terraform state show, terraform state mv, and terraform state rm enable you to view, move, or remove resources from the state. This is useful for fixing discrepancies or reorganizing resources without affecting the actual infrastructure.",
    "33":"Improved Result Diversity: By giving higher scores to results that appear high in any of the combined rankings, Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) reduces bias from single algorithms and increases the diversity and quality of search outcomes, ensuring more comprehensive results for users.",
    "34":"The Stable Diffusion model is a good starting point, and since its official launch, several improved versions have also been released. However, using a newer version doesn\u2019t automatically mean you\u2019ll get better results. You\u2019ll still have to experiment with different checkpoints yourself, and do a little research (such as using negative prompts) to get the best results.",
    "35":"Pagination and $top\nDefinition: Pagination refers to breaking down large sets of data into smaller, more manageable chunks. The $top query parameter controls how many records are returned in a single request.\nRelevance: For performance reasons, Dataverse limits the number of records returned in a single API request. Pagination, along with $top, helps in retrieving large datasets incrementally without overwhelming the system.",
    "36":"Score-based Models\nA type of diffusion model that estimates a \"score\" or gradient, representing how much to adjust each pixel to reduce noise. These models iteratively improve an image by minimizing the noise, guided by a score function that optimizes image coherence.",
    "37":"$expand\nDefinition: An OData query option that allows retrieving related data in a single query by expanding related entities.\nRelevance: The $expand option is highly useful when you need to retrieve related data (e.g., including a parent entity's information in the same query). It reduces the number of separate API calls required to retrieve related data, optimizing performance.",
    "38":"In Lesson 1, we engineered our time dummy in Pandas directly. From now on, however, we'll use a function from the statsmodels library called DeterministicProcess. Using this function will help us avoid some tricky failure cases that can arise with time series and linear regression. The order argument refers to polynomial order: 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, 3 for cubic, and so on.",
    "39":"Creating POST Requests in Power Query: You can modify Power Query M code to create a POST request by specifying the endpoint URL, headers (such as Content-Type: application\/json), and request body.

    "42":"OpenID Connect versus SAML: The platform uses both OpenID Connect and SAML to authenticate a user and enable single sign-on. SAML authentication is commonly used with identity providers such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) federated to Microsoft Entra ID, so it's often used in enterprise applications.",
    "43":"You can set a sandbox, production, or trial (subscription-based) environment in administration mode so that only users with System Administrator or System Customizer security roles will be able to sign in to that environment.
