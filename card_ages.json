    "0":"When you make a request, the Requests library prepares the request before actually sending it to the destination server. Request preparation includes things like validating headers and serializing JSON content.\n\nYou can view the PreparedRequest object by accessing .request on a Response object:",
    "1":"Sessions are used to persist parameters across requests. For example, if you want to use the same authentication across multiple requests, then you can use a session:\n\nimport requests\n\nTOKEN = \"<YOUR_GITHUB_PA_TOKEN>\"\n\nwith requests.Session() as session:\n    session.auth = TokenAuth(TOKEN)\n\n    first_response = session.get(\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/user\")\n    second_response = session.get(\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/user\")",
    "2":"Because the decoding of bytes to a str requires an encoding scheme, Requests will try to guess the encoding based on the response\u2019s headers if you don\u2019t specify one. You can provide an explicit encoding by setting .encoding before accessing .text:\n\n>>> response.encoding = \"utf-8\"  # Optional: Requests infers this.\n>>> response.text\n'{\"current_user_url\":\"https:\/\/api.github.com\/user\", ...}'",
    "3":"To create an iterator in Python, you need to implement .__iter__() and .__next__().\n\nThe .__iter__() special method initializes the iterator and must return an iterator object, typically self.\n\nThe .__next__() method retrieves the next value in the data stream and must raise a StopIteration exception when the data stream is exhausted.",
    "4":"According to the HTTP specification, POST, PUT, and the less common PATCH requests pass their data through the message body rather than through parameters in the query string. Using Requests, you\u2019ll pass the payload to the corresponding function\u2019s data parameter.\n\ndata takes a dictionary, a list of tuples, bytes, or a file-like object.",
    "5":"import re\n\ndef replace_punctuations_and_spaces(input_string):\n    # Define the pattern to match all punctuations and spaces\n    pattern = r'[^\\w]'\n    # Replace all matched characters with an empty string\n    result = re.sub(pattern, '', input_string)\n    return result",
    "6":"To make a class iterable, you need to define the .__iter__() special method in the class. This method must return an iterator, which Python uses in its iteration protocol.",
    "7":"In Python, special methods support comparison operators.\n\nFor example, the .__lt__() method supports the < operator, .__gt__() supports >, and the .__eq__() method supports the == operator.\n\nThese methods allow you to define custom behavior for comparison operations in your custom classes.",
    "8":"Authentication helps a service understand who you are. Typically, you provide your credentials to a server by passing data through the Authorization header or a custom header defined by the service. All the functions of Requests that you\u2019ve seen to this point provide a parameter called auth, which allows you to pass your credentials:\n\n>>> import requests\n\n>>> response = requests.get(\n...     \"https:\/\/httpbin.org\/basic-auth\/user\/passwd\",\n...     auth=(\"user\", \"passwd\")\n... )",
    "9":"The response headers can give you useful information, such as the content type of the response payload and a time limit on how long to cache the response. To view these headers, access .headers:\n\n>>> import requests\n\n>>> response = requests.get(\"https:\/\/api.github.com\")\n>>> response.headers\n{'Server': 'GitHub.com',\n...\n'X-GitHub-Request-Id': 'AE83:3F40:2151C46:438A840:65C38178'}",
    "10":"If you invoke Response.raise_for_status(), then Requests will raise an HTTPError for status codes between 400 and 600. If the status code indicates a successful request, then the program will proceed without raising that exception.",
    "11":"In Python, you can compare sequences of the same type. When comparing two sequences, the first \nnon-equal\n value determines the outcome.\n\nFor example, consider the following lists:\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nmore_numbers = [1, 2, 2, 10, 20]\nWhen you compare these lists, you\u2019ll find that numbers is greater than more_numbers.",
    "12":"The re.sub function replaces all occurrences of a specified pattern in a string with a given replacement by default. If you want to replace only the first instance, you can use the count parameter and set it to 1.",
    "13":"Note: Requests uses a package called certifi to provide certificate authorities. This lets Requests know which authorities it can trust. Therefore, you should update certifi frequently to keep your connections as secure as possible.",
    "14":"TorchText is part of the PyTorch ecosystem and is designed to handle text data for natural language processing tasks. It offers tools for managing data loading, applying text transformations, and integrating with datasets.\n\nThis library simplifies tasks like text classification and language modeling by making vocabulary creation and tokenization more straightforward.",
    "15":"Many popular machine learning algorithms and datasets are built into TensorFlow and are ready to use. In addition to the built-in datasets, you can access Google Research Datasets or use Google\u2019s Dataset Search to find even more.",
    "16":"The load_tests() function in Python\u2019s unittest framework is a hook for customizing test loading and suite creation. It takes three arguments: a test loader, a series of tests, and a test discovery pattern. When you call unittest.main(), load_tests() gets called automatically.",
    "17":"More coding languages are supported in TensorFlow than in PyTorch, which has a C++ API. You can use TensorFlow in both JavaScript and Swift. If you don\u2019t want to write much low-level code, then Keras abstracts away a lot of the details for common use cases so you can build TensorFlow models without sweating the details.",
    "18":"The common practice is to use lists for homogeneous objects and tuples for heterogeneous objects. Lists are typically used when all elements are of the same type, while tuples are used when elements are of different types.",
    "19":".headers returns a dictionary-like object, allowing you to access header values by key. For example, to see the content type of the response payload, you can access \"Content-Type\":\n\n>>> response.headers[\"Content-Type\"]\n'application\/json; charset=utf-8'\n\nThere\u2019s something special about this dictionary-like headers object, though. The HTTP specification defines headers as case-insensitive, which means that you\u2019re able to access these headers without worrying about their capitalization:",
    "20":"The CRUD operations correspond almost one-to-one with SQL commands:\n\nCreate: INSERT\nRead: SELECT\nUpdate: UPDATE\nDelete: DELETE\nSo, to modify existing data in SQL, you would use the UPDATE command.",
    "21":"When you try to create an instance of a class that inherits from the Sequence abstract base class, but doesn\u2019t implement .__getitem__() and .__len__(), then Python raises a TypeError:\n\nThe Sequence abstract base class requires that any class that inherits from it must implement the .__getitem__() and .__len__() methods.",
    "22":"Python sequences have three common characteristics:\n\n  They are iterable, which means you can iterate through them.\n  They have a length, which means you can pass them to len() to get the number of elements it contains.\n  An element of a sequence can be accessed based on its position in the sequence using an integer index.",
    "23":"When a request fails, you may want your application to retry the same request. However, Requests won\u2019t do this for you by default. To apply this functionality, you need to implement a custom transport adapter.\n\nTransport adapters let you define a set of configurations for each service that you\u2019re interacting with.",
    "24":"You don\u2019t need to use a dedicated tool to create a README file for your project. You can use any plain text editor for this task. However, there are many tools available that can help automate the README creation process. You can read more about this in the section on tools for README creation.",
    "25":"In Python\u2019s unittest package, you can use fixtures to set up and tear down test environments for each test method. To do this, you can use the setUp() and tearDown() method, respectively. These methods are automatically called before and after each test method.",
    "26":"PyTorch is based on Torch, a framework for doing fast computation that is written in C. Torch has a Lua wrapper for constructing models.\n\nPyTorch wraps the same C back end in a Python interface. But it\u2019s more than just a wrapper. Developers built it from the ground up to make models easy to write for Python programmers.",
    "27":"A Delta Token is a marker used in Delta Queries to track changes since the last query. Clients use delta tokens to request only the changes (additions, deletions, updates) that have occurred since their last synchronization, optimizing data retrieval.",
    "28":"An ETag is a mechanism for concurrency control in OData, representing a version identifier for a resource. It ensures that updates or deletions are performed on the correct version of a record, preventing conflicts and maintaining data integrity.",
    "29":"Formatting Instructions are guidelines that specify how data should be presented or displayed. Defined using annotations, they help client applications render data appropriately, such as formatting dates, numbers, or currencies in a user-friendly manner.",
    "30":"While not directly related to OData or Dataverse, yield is a programming concept used in iterators to return values one at a time. It is useful in broader API interactions and data processing but is not a primary term in the OData\/Dataverse context.",
    "31":"Inheritance Hierarchies allow entities to derive properties and behaviors from parent entities, enabling reuse and polymorphism. Managed in Dataverse using OData's @odata.type, they allow clients to interact with a hierarchy of related entity types effectively.",
    "32":"DNS Zone Types\nDifferent types of DNS zones include Primary, Secondary, Stub, and Active Directory-Integrated zones. Each type serves distinct roles in DNS management, such as data storage, redundancy, delegation, and integration with directory services.",
    "33":"Serialization is the process of converting objects or data structures into a format like JSON or XML for transmission or storage. In OData, serialization ensures that data sent over the Web API is standardized, enabling clients to understand and process it effectively.",
    "34":"Complex Types are structured data types in OData that group multiple related properties into a single reusable structure. They allow for more organized and modular data models by encapsulating related data, such as addresses or contact information.",
    "35":"Annotations provide additional metadata about entities, properties, or relationships in the OData model. They enrich the data with information like display names, validation rules, and formatting instructions, enhancing both data semantics and client-side interactions.",

    "395":"Improved Result Diversity: By giving higher scores to results that appear high in any of the combined rankings, Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) reduces bias from single algorithms and increases the diversity and quality of search outcomes, ensuring more comprehensive results for users.",
    "396":"Type Casting converts an entity from one type to another within inheritance hierarchies. In OData, it is facilitated by the @odata.type annotation, which specifies the target type for the cast, ensuring accurate data interpretation and processing.",
    "397":"The @odata.type annotation specifies the exact entity type or derived type being referenced in an OData payload. It is crucial for handling inheritance and polymorphism by informing clients about the specific type of an entity for correct deserialization and processing.",
    "398":"A Polymorphic Association is a relationship where an entity can be associated with multiple types of other entities. It requires the use of @odata.type to identify the specific type of related entities, enabling flexible and dynamic associations within the data model.",
    "399":"Delta Queries allow clients to track changes (additions, deletions, updates) and synchronize data efficiently without retrieving the entire dataset each time. This feature optimizes performance and reduces bandwidth usage by enabling incremental data synchronization.",
    "400":"Bayesian Inference\nThe process of updating probabilities based on new data, often used to refine diffusion model outputs. Bayesian inference adjusts prior beliefs about data distribution with observed data, allowing for improved posterior estimates in reverse diffusion steps, enhancing image realism."
