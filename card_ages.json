    "77":"If there are data sources being accessed within the partition, and data flowing in from other partitions, the Firewall loses its ability to be the gatekeeper, since the data flowing in could be leaked to one of the internally accessed data sources without it knowing about it. Thus the Firewall prevents a partition that accesses other partitions from being allowed to directly access any data sources.",
    "79":"The first bit of information that you can gather from Response is the status code. A status code informs you of the status of the request.\n\nFor example, a 200 OK status means that your request was successful, whereas a 404 NOT FOUND status means that the resource you were looking for wasn\u2019t found. There are many other possible status codes as well to give you specific insights into what happened with your request.",
    "75":"On Windows, pip relies on a small launcher executable that links to the correct Python interpreter and pip package. If Python was uninstalled and reinstalled in a new location, the link in that launcher may be broken or still pointing to the old installation path, even if the correct paths are in the Path variable. This causes pip alone to fail, as it tries to find the old, non-existent Python.",

    "23":"The purpose of the .__init__() method in a Python class is to initialize instance attributes.\n\nWhen you create an instance of a class, Python automatically calls .__init__() using the same arguments that you\u2019ve passed to the constructor. This method sets up the initial state of the object by assigning values to instance attributes.",
    "104":"Gaussian Process\nA probabilistic model for defining distributions over functions, often used in the context of continuous random noise. In diffusion, Gaussian processes model how noise is applied over time, treating noise at each step as a sample from a Gaussian distribution for simplicity.",
    "32":"Transforming API Data into Usable Tables: API responses often contain nested structures (e.g., records, lists). In Power BI, you use the Expand functionality to convert these structures into tables, making the data easier to manipulate. Data transformation may include renaming columns, changing data types, or removing unnecessary fields.",
