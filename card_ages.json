You might think this represents a division or line continuation symbol, but it\u2019s neither. By placing the forward slash special parameter at the end, the documentation is telling you that each parameter passed must be passed by position and not by keyword.",

A status code informs you of the status of the request.\n\nFor example, a 200 OK status means that your request was successful, whereas a 404 NOT FOUND status means that the resource you were looking for wasn\u2019t found. There are many other possible status codes as well to give you specific insights into what happened with your request.",

Provide the refresh_token instead of the code. Refresh tokens are valid for all permissions that your client has already received consent for.",
    "70":"On Windows, pip relies on a small launcher executable that links to the correct Python interpreter and pip package. If Python was uninstalled and reinstalled in a new location, the link in that launcher may be broken or still pointing to the old installation path, even if the correct paths are in the Path variable. This causes pip alone to fail, as it tries to find the old, non-existent Python.",

Developers built it from the ground up to make models easy to write for Python programmers.",
    "234":"The redirect URIs to use in a desktop application depend on the flow you want to use.\n\nSpecify the redirect URI for your app by configuring the platform settings for the app in App registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.\n\nFor apps that use Web Authentication Manager (WAM), redirect URIs need not be configured in MSAL, but they must be configured in the app registration.",
    "343":"Named replacement fields allow you to insert values from a dictionary into a string by using keys. This method is more readable and intuitive than using positional arguments with tuples.",
    "345":"When it comes to pre-trained models, TensorFlow Hub steps in with models that you can use right away, like ResNet and MobileNet. You can save time by using these models to recognize patterns or objects in images so you don\u2019t have to start from scratch.",
    "341":"To customize headers, you pass a dictionary of HTTP headers to get() using the headers parameter. For example, you can change your previous search request to highlight matching search terms in the results by specifying the text-match media type in the Accept header:\n\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\n    \"https:\/\/api.github.com\/search\/repositories\",\n    params={\"q\": '\"real python\"'},\n    headers={\"Accept\": \"application\/vnd.github.text-match+json\"},\n)",
    "167":"You can set a sandbox, production, or trial (subscription-based) environment in administration mode so that only users with System Administrator or System Customizer security roles will be able to sign in to that environment. Administration mode is useful when you want to make operational changes and not have regular users affect your work, and not have your work affect end users (non-admins).",
    "313":"Score-based Models\nA type of diffusion model that estimates a \"score\" or gradient, representing how much to adjust each pixel to reduce noise. These models iteratively improve an image by minimizing the noise, guided by a score function that optimizes image coherence.",
    "212":"\u2022 DNS Forwarding:\nThe process of forwarding DNS queries from one DNS server to another, often used in corporate networks to ensure that all DNS traffic passes through a specific DNS server.",
    "57":"The terraform plan -refresh-only option generates a plan that only refreshes the state without proposing any changes to infrastructure. This is useful for seeing the current state of resources, particularly when changes have been made outside of Terraform, allowing you to compare infrastructure with the configuration.",
    "6":"At report design time in Microsoft Power BI Desktop, you can create measures (except when the model is a live connection to SQL Server Analysis Services multidimensional model). These measures belong to the report, and so they're called report-level measures.",
    "138":"Serverless workflow. A series of functions can be chained together, and you can introduce state which makes it possible to devise complex long running workflows via Durable Functions. Another choice for workflows is Logic apps that can monitor external events, perform branching logic and invoke functions as a result.",
    "58":"The terraform state command family allows you to manipulate the state file directly. Commands like terraform state show, terraform state mv, and terraform state rm enable you to view, move, or remove resources from the state. This is useful for fixing discrepancies or reorganizing resources without affecting the actual infrastructure.",
    "224":"KFold: KFold splits data into k consecutive folds (typically 5 or 10) for cross-validation, ensuring each fold is used as both a training and validation set. It\u2019s widely used for balanced datasets, providing reliable estimates of a model\u2019s performance on unseen data.",
    "312":"Noise Schedule\nA sequence controlling the amount of noise added to images at each diffusion step. This progressive reduction allows the model to learn to denoise by removing specific levels of noise at each step, eventually generating a clear image from the noise.",
    "200":"Neighbors-based classification is computed from a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point: a query point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives within the nearest neighbors of the point.",
    "346":"You don\u2019t need to use a dedicated tool to create a README file for your project. You can use any plain text editor for this task. However, there are many tools available that can help automate the README creation process. You can read more about this in the section on tools for README creation.",
