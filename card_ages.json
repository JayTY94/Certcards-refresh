    "0":"Gaussian Process\nA probabilistic model for defining distributions over functions, often used in the context of continuous random noise. In diffusion, Gaussian processes model how noise is applied over time, treating noise at each step as a sample from a Gaussian distribution for simplicity.",
    "1":"\u2022 DNS Rebinding:\nA technique used by attackers to bypass the same-origin policy in browsers, allowing them to interact with private networks by making the DNS response point to a local IP address after an initial resolution to a public IP.",
    "2":"The first bit of information that you can gather from Response is the status code. A status code informs you of the status of the request.\n\nFor example, a 200 OK status means that your request was successful, whereas a 404 NOT FOUND status means that the resource you were looking for wasn\u2019t found. There are many other possible status codes as well to give you specific insights into what happened with your request.",
    "3":"Sometimes, old environment paths can linger in the registry or elsewhere in the system\u2019s path cache, causing confusion about which Python executable should be used. Running python -m pip explicitly tells the Python interpreter itself to find the correct pip module, sidestepping any possible confusion from old, broken pip links.",
    "4":"Bayesian Inference\nThe process of updating probabilities based on new data, often used to refine diffusion model outputs. Bayesian inference adjusts prior beliefs about data distribution with observed data, allowing for improved posterior estimates in reverse diffusion steps, enhancing image realism.",
    "5":"On Windows, pip relies on a small launcher executable that links to the correct Python interpreter and pip package. If Python was uninstalled and reinstalled in a new location, the link in that launcher may be broken or still pointing to the old installation path, even if the correct paths are in the Path variable. This causes pip alone to fail, as it tries to find the old, non-existent Python.",
    "6":"Access tokens are short lived. Refresh them after they expire to continue accessing resources. You can do so by submitting another POST request to the \/token endpoint. Provide the refresh_token instead of the code. Refresh tokens are valid for all permissions that your client has already received consent for.",
    "7":"The redirect URIs to use in a desktop application depend on the flow you want to use.\n\nSpecify the redirect URI for your app by configuring the platform settings for the app in App registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.\n\nFor apps that use Web Authentication Manager (WAM), redirect URIs need not be configured in MSAL, but they must be configured in the app registration.",
    "8":"Confidential Client:\n\nDefinition: An application type in OAuth2 that requires a client secret or assertion, typically used by server-based or service applications.\nContext: Initially, your app was likely configured as a confidential client, which caused the error when we tried using Device Code Flow.",
    "9":"The purpose of the .__init__() method in a Python class is to initialize instance attributes.\n\nWhen you create an instance of a class, Python automatically calls .__init__() using the same arguments that you\u2019ve passed to the constructor. This method sets up the initial state of the object by assigning values to instance attributes.",
    "10":"When it comes to pre-trained models, TensorFlow Hub steps in with models that you can use right away, like ResNet and MobileNet. You can save time by using these models to recognize patterns or objects in images so you don\u2019t have to start from scratch.",
    "11":"Expanding List-Like Elements into Rows using explode: The explode method transforms each element of a list-like column into separate rows by applying DataFrame.explode. This allows you to analyze each list element individually in a row-wise fashion.",
    "12":"PyTorch is based on Torch, a framework for doing fast computation that is written in C.

Developers built it from the ground up to make models easy to write for Python programmers.",
    "13":"LeavePGroupsOut: This cross-validation technique splits data based on group labels, leaving out all data points with a specific group label in each fold. Useful for datasets with naturally grouped data, where each group should either entirely be in training or test sets.",
    "14":"\u2022 DNS Tunneling:\nA method of encapsulating data within DNS queries and responses to bypass network firewalls and restrictions, often used in data exfiltration or command-and-control channels.",
    "15":"In Lesson 1, we engineered our time dummy in Pandas directly. From now on, however, we'll use a function from the statsmodels library called DeterministicProcess. Using this function will help us avoid some tricky failure cases that can arise with time series and linear regression. The order argument refers to polynomial order: 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, 3 for cubic, and so on.",
    "16":"$expand\nDefinition: An OData query option that allows retrieving related data in a single query by expanding related entities.\nRelevance: The $expand option is highly useful when you need to retrieve related data (e.g., including a parent entity's information in the same query). It reduces the number of separate API calls required to retrieve related data, optimizing performance.",
    "17":"\u2022 DNS Forwarding:\nThe process of forwarding DNS queries from one DNS server to another, often used in corporate networks to ensure that all DNS traffic passes through a specific DNS server.",
    "18":"Control Over Record Path and Metadata in json_normalize: With json_normalize, you can specify the path to the records you want to normalize using the record_path parameter. The meta parameter in json_normalize allows you to include metadata from parent levels, ensuring hierarchical data is accurately represented.",
    "19":"The terraform state command family allows you to manipulate the state file directly. Commands like terraform state show, terraform state mv, and terraform state rm enable you to view, move, or remove resources from the state. This is useful for fixing discrepancies or reorganizing resources without affecting the actual infrastructure.",
    "20":"Serverless workflow. A series of functions can be chained together, and you can introduce state which makes it possible to devise complex long running workflows via Durable Functions. Another choice for workflows is Logic apps that can monitor external events, perform branching logic and invoke functions as a result.",
    "21":"To customize headers, you pass a dictionary of HTTP headers to get() using the headers parameter. For example, you can change your previous search request to highlight matching search terms in the results by specifying the text-match media type in the Accept header:\n\nimport requests\n\nresponse = requests.get(\n    \"https:\/\/api.github.com\/search\/repositories\",\n    params={\"q\": '\"real python\"'},\n    headers={\"Accept\": \"application\/vnd.github.text-match+json\"},\n)",
    "22":"In Power Query Diagnostics, 'Diagnose Step' is more useful for getting an insight into what evaluations are happening up to a single step, which can help you identify, up to that step, what performance is like as well as what parts of your query are being performed locally or remotely.",
    "23":"Diffusion Model\nA generative model that gradually converts random noise into an image by iteratively refining it through multiple steps, guided by trained patterns learned from data. This is achieved through a process that \"diffuses\" image details from a noise-laden starting point to a coherent output.",
    "24":"OpenID Connect versus SAML: The platform uses both OpenID Connect and SAML to authenticate a user and enable single sign-on. SAML authentication is commonly used with identity providers such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) federated to Microsoft Entra ID, so it's often used in enterprise applications.",
    "25":"Most models take a noisy sample, and each timestep it predicts the noise residual (other models elarn to predict the previous sample directly or hte velcity or v-prediction), the difference between a less noisy image and the input image. You can mix and match models to create other diffusion systems.",
    "26":"Improved Result Diversity: By giving higher scores to results that appear high in any of the combined rankings, Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) reduces bias from single algorithms and increases the diversity and quality of search outcomes, ensuring more comprehensive results for users.",
    "27":"Noise Schedule\nA sequence controlling the amount of noise added to images at each diffusion step. This progressive reduction allows the model to learn to denoise by removing specific levels of noise at each step, eventually generating a clear image from the noise.",
    "28":"Score-based Models\nA type of diffusion model that estimates a \"score\" or gradient, representing how much to adjust each pixel to reduce noise. These models iteratively improve an image by minimizing the noise, guided by a score function that optimizes image coherence.",
    "29":"The terraform plan -refresh-only option generates a plan that only refreshes the state without proposing any changes to infrastructure. This is useful for seeing the current state of resources, particularly when changes have been made outside of Terraform, allowing you to compare infrastructure with the configuration.",
    "30":"Each storage account requires some time and attention from an administrator to create and maintain. It also increases complexity for anyone who adds data to your cloud storage. Everyone in an administrator role needs to understand the purpose of each storage account so they add new data to the correct account.",
    "31":"Creating POST Requests in Power Query: You can modify Power Query M code to create a POST request by specifying the endpoint URL, headers (such as Content-Type: application\/json), and request body. The body is structured as JSON using Json.FromValue(), converted to binary with Text.ToBinary(), and passed to the Web.Contents() function.",
    "32":"Magic methods, also known as special methods or dunder methods, are methods in Python whose names start and end with a double underscore.\n\nThese methods have special meanings and are automatically called by Python in response to certain operations, such as instantiation, sequence indexing, and attribute management.",
    "33":"The re.sub function replaces all occurrences of a specified pattern in a string with a given replacement by default. If you want to replace only the first instance, you can use the count parameter and set it to 1.",
    "34":"KFold: KFold splits data into k consecutive folds (typically 5 or 10) for cross-validation, ensuring each fold is used as both a training and validation set. It\u2019s widely used for balanced datasets, providing reliable estimates of a model\u2019s performance on unseen data.",
    "35":"Augmented assignment operators provide a more concise way to update the value of a variable. For example, counter += 1 is a shorthand for counter = counter + 1.\n\nThese operators rely on special methods like .__iadd__() for in-place operations. If the data type is mutable, then Python performs the operation in place. If the data type is immutable, Python returns a new object with the updated value.",
    "36":"FetchXML\nDefinition: A proprietary query language used in Dataverse for more advanced querying capabilities. Although the Web API primarily supports OData queries, FetchXML can be used for complex querying scenarios such as joins, aggregates, and advanced filtering.\nRelevance: FetchXML is particularly useful for scenarios where OData query limitations are encountered. It can be executed using the Web API through the RetrieveMultiple message.",
    "37":"In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, an n-dimensional manifold, or n-manifold for short, is a topological space with the property that each point has a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of n-dimensional Euclidean space.",
