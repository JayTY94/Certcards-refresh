    "378":"Front: How can you whitelist a domain in Pi-hole, and why would you do it?\n\nBack: To whitelist a domain in Pi-hole, you add the domain to the whitelist through the Pi-hole admin interface or using command-line tools. Whitelisting ensures that Pi-hole allows DNS resolution for that domain, which is useful for preventing the blocking of legitimate services or applications that rely on specific domains.",
    "374":"Front: Explain PromQL in the context of Prometheus.\n\nBack: PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) is a powerful query language used to retrieve and manipulate time-series data stored in Prometheus. It allows users to perform calculations, aggregations, and transformations to analyze metrics and generate meaningful insights.",
    "362":"Front: Define Reverse Proxy and its common uses.\n\nBack: A Reverse Proxy is a server that sits between client devices and backend servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate server. Common uses include load balancing, caching, SSL termination, and enhancing security by hiding the identities and structures of backend servers.",
    "363":"Front: What is Port Forwarding and how is it configured on a router?\n\nBack: Port Forwarding is the process of directing incoming traffic on specific ports from the router to designated devices within the local network. It is configured through the router\u2019s admin interface by specifying the external port, internal IP address, and internal port, enabling services like VPNs, game servers, or web servers to be accessible externally.",
    "377":"Front: Explain the purpose of AllowedIPs in WireGuard configuration.\n\nBack: AllowedIPs defines the IP addresses that are permitted to be routed through the VPN tunnel for a specific peer. It acts as both an access control list and routing rule, determining which traffic should be encrypted and sent through the VPN and which should bypass it.",
    "376":"Front: What is a Peer in WireGuard terminology?\n\nBack: In WireGuard, a peer is an endpoint in the VPN network. Each peer has its own public and private keys and a configuration that specifies allowed IPs and connection details. Peers communicate directly with each other once the VPN is established, forming a secure mesh network.",
    "361":"Front: What is Port Mapping in Docker and why is it important?\n\nBack: Port Mapping in Docker connects a port on the host machine to a port inside a Docker container. It allows external access to services running within containers. For example, mapping host port 80 to container port 80 enables users to access a web server running inside the container via the host's IP address on port 80.",
