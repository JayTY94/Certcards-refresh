For example, if you want a function to execute every 10 minutes, you could use a timer trigger.\n\nEvery function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to execute a piece of logic that runs under multiple conditions, you need to create multiple functions that share the same core function code.",

This method sets up the initial state of the object by assigning values to instance attributes.",
    "9":"Once we've identified the shape of the trend, we can attempt to model it using a time-step feature. We've already seen how using the time dummy itself will model a linear trend:\ntarget = a * time + b\n\nWe can fit many other kinds of trend through transformations of the time dummy. If the trend appears to be quadratic (a parabola), we just need to add the square of the time dummy to the feature set, giving us:\ntarget = a * time ** 2 + b * time + c",
