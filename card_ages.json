    "8":"You would typically use np.where() when you have an array and need to analyze its elements differently depending on their values. For example, you might need to replace negative numbers with zeros or replace missing values such as None or np.nan with something more meaningful. When you run where(), you\u2019ll produce a new array containing the results of your analysis.",
    "9":"Once we've identified the shape of the trend, we can attempt to model it using a time-step feature. We've already seen how using the time dummy itself will model a linear trend:\ntarget = a * time + b\n\nWe can fit many other kinds of trend through transformations of the time dummy. If the trend appears to be quadratic (a parabola), we just need to add the square of the time dummy to the feature set, giving us:\ntarget = a * time ** 2 + b * time + c",

    "21":"Use the auth code flow paired with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) and OpenID Connect (OIDC) to get access tokens and ID tokens in these types of apps:\n\nSingle-page web application (SPA)\nStandard (server-based) web application\nDesktop and mobile apps",
    "22":"If a change to one piece of data must result in a change to another piece of data, an application needs to group together a series of data updates. You can use transactions to group these updates. In a transaction, if one event in a series of updates fails, the entire series can be rolled back or undone.",
    "23":"A storage account represents a collection of settings like location, replication strategy, and subscription owner. You need one storage account for each group of settings that you want to apply to your data. The following illustration shows two storage accounts that differ in one setting (region); that one difference is enough to require separate storage accounts.",
