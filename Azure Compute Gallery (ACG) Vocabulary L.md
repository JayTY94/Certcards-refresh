Azure Compute Gallery (ACG) Vocabulary List
1. Compute Gallery Concepts
Azure Compute Gallery (ACG) â€“ A service that helps manage, share, and distribute VM images across multiple subscriptions and regions.
Compute Gallery Resource â€“ The top-level container that stores multiple image definitions and versions.
Subscription Scope â€“ ACG is tied to a single subscription, but images can be shared across multiple subscriptions under the same Azure AD tenant.
Resource Group â€“ A logical container that holds the Compute Gallery, Image Definitions, and Image Versions.
Cross-Subscription Sharing â€“ ACG images can be shared with multiple subscriptions, but not across Azure AD tenants.
Cross-Tenant Sharing â€“ Not supported in ACG; images cannot be shared between different Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenants.
2. Image Structure
Image Definition â€“ A logical representation of an image, specifying OS type, publisher, and general metadata.
Image Version â€“ A specific iteration of an image (e.g., 1.0.0, 2.1.0), stored in one or more regions.
Image Gallery Replication â€“ The process of copying an image version to multiple regions to optimize availability and speed.
Replication Region Limit â€“ Each image version can be replicated to a maximum of 50 regions.
Image Retention Policy â€“ A strategy for keeping or removing older image versions to manage storage costs and subscription quotas.
3. Image Types
Generalized Image â€“ A VM image that has been "cleaned" of system-specific data (using Sysprep for Windows or waagent -deprovision for Linux) to be reused across multiple VM deployments.
Specialized Image â€“ A VM image that retains system-specific settings, including machine name, user accounts, and configurationsâ€”ideal for cloning.
Managed Image â€“ A single, region-bound image stored in Azure, lacking versioning and replication features found in ACG.
OS Disk Image â€“ An image containing only the operating system and configurations.
Data Disk Image â€“ A separate image that includes application and data disks but does not contain an OS.
Shared Image â€“ An image in ACG that is accessible across multiple subscriptions with proper RBAC configuration.
4. Image Creation Methods
Manual Image Creation
Capture from Existing VM â€“ Creating an image by generalizing or specializing a VM and capturing it into ACG.
Manual VHD Upload â€“ A process where you create a VHD file, upload it to Azure Storage, and convert it into an image.
Azure Marketplace Image as a Base â€“ Using a pre-configured image from Azure Marketplace to deploy new VMs.
Automated Image Creation
Azure Image Builder (AIB) â€“ A managed service that automates image creation by defining customizations (e.g., software installations, updates, configurations).
Packer â€“ An open-source tool that automates multi-cloud VM image building, often used with Terraform or Azure DevOps.
Terraform Compute Gallery Module â€“ A way to define ACG image builds and deployments using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
Azure DevOps Pipelines for Image Deployment â€“ A CI/CD workflow that automatically builds, tests, and publishes images.
5. Deployment & Access
VM Deployment from ACG â€“ The process of creating VM instances using images stored in Azure Compute Gallery.
Shared Image Gallery Reader Role â€“ An RBAC role that allows users to access images for deployment but not modify them.
Deployment Latency â€“ The time required for a newly published image to become available for VM creation.
Ephemeral OS Disk â€“ A temporary VM disk that cannot be used with ACG images.
Replication Completion Check â€“ Before deploying a VM, images must be fully replicated to the region where deployment is taking place.
6. Versioning & Storage
Semantic Versioning (SemVer) â€“ The required format (X.Y.Z, e.g., 1.0.0) for ACG image versions.
Immutable Image Versions â€“ Once an image version is published, it cannot be modifiedâ€”a new version must be created.
Maximum Image Versions Per Definition â€“ Each image definition can store up to 1,000 versions.
Storage Costs for ACG â€“ Storage pricing depends on:
Number of versions retained
Number of replicas in different regions
Image size
Image Version Deletion â€“ Permanent action that cannot be undone.
7. Security & Access Control
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) â€“ Azure's permission model for granting access to ACG images.
Azure Compute Gallery Roles:
Reader â€“ Can list and read images.
Contributor â€“ Can create and manage images.
Owner â€“ Full control over the gallery.
Shared Image Gallery Reader â€“ Read-only access to images across subscriptions.
SAS Token (Shared Access Signature) â€“ A temporary, secure URL-based access method often used for sharing VHD files in Azure Storage.
8. Planning & Limitations
Subscription & Region Restrictions
One Compute Gallery Per Subscription â€“ ACG is bound to a single Azure subscription.
Region Availability â€“ Not all Azure regions support Compute Gallery replication.
Azure Government & Sovereign Clouds â€“ Some regions (e.g., China, US Gov) have restricted ACG availability.
Quota & Scaling Limits
Subscription Quotas â€“ Limits on the number of image versions, definitions, and replication regions.
Replication Time Constraints â€“ Image replication is not instantaneous and can take several minutes to hours.
Governance & Compliance
Azure Policy Enforcement â€“ Some organizations restrict Compute Gallery usage via Azure Policies.
License Considerations â€“ Some images (e.g., RHEL, Windows Server) require Azure Hybrid Benefit or additional licensing.
9. Key Takeaways
Azure Compute Gallery allows scalable, multi-region image management, but requires careful subscription, replication, and versioning planning.
Image versions are immutable â€“ Plan versioning strategies carefully.
Replication increases storage costs â€“ Select replication regions strategically.
RBAC must be explicitly assigned â€“ Cross-subscription access is not automatic.
Automation (AIB, Packer, Terraform) improves efficiency â€“ Use DevOps workflows to standardize image creation.
