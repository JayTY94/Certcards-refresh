Sensitive information types (SITs) are used to help identify sensitive data so that you can prevent it from being inadvertently or inappropriately shared. You define a custom SIT based on:

    patterns
    keyword evidence such as employee, social security number, or ID
    character proximity to evidence in a particular pattern
    confidence levels

Exact Data Match (EDM)-based classification enables you to  create custom SITs that refer to exact values in a database of sensitive information. The database can be refreshed daily and can contain up to 100 million rows of data.
