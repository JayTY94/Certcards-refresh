It's a best practice to avoid writing SQL queries directly in Power BI. Instead, consider writing a query like this in a view. A view is an object in a relational database, similar to a table. Views have rows and columns, and can contain almost every operator in the SQL language. If Power BI uses a view, when it retrieves data, it participates in query folding, a feature of Power Query.

When you're creating a dashboard in Power BI, you can move or arrange tiles however you want. You can make them bigger, change their height or width, and snuggle them up to other tiles.

When you're viewing, or consuming, a dashboard or report—which means you're not the creator or owner, but the report or dashboard has been shared with you—you can interact with it, but you can't change the size of the tiles or their arrangement.

Parameters can be created for a wide range of data types, including dates, numbers, and text. You can also set up a parameter to allow users to select from a list of predefined values.

When using an SQL query to import data, try to avoid using the wildcard character (*) in your query. If you use the wildcard character in your select statement, you import all columns from the specified table.

It's important to note that while parameters can be a powerful tool for creating dynamic reports, they can also add complexity to your data model. You'll want to make sure you're using parameters effectively and efficiently to avoid performance issues. Additionally, not all data sources may support parameters, so it's important to check the documentation for your specific data source to see if parameters are supported.

Parameters allow you to create more flexible and dynamic reports and dashboards by allowing users to customize aspects of the report. For example, you can set up a parameter to allow users to select a specific date range to view data for.

An example of a Pipeline check is a manual approval check on an environment, which would ensure that deployment to that environment only happens after the designated user(s) has reviewed the changes being deployed.

Your Excel files might exist in one of the following locations:
OneDrive for Business - You can pull data from OneDrive for Business into Power BI. This method is effective in keeping an Excel file and your dataset, reports, and dashboards in Power BI synchronized. Power BI connects regularly to your file on OneDrive. If any changes are found, your dataset, reports, and dashboards are automatically updated in Power BI.

You can use parameters by determining the values that you want to see data for in the report, and the report updates accordingly by filtering the data for you.

Creating dynamic reports allows you to give users more power over the data that is displayed in your reports; they can change the data source and filter the data by themselves.

Authentication method(s) for SQL Server databases in Power BI:
Database - Use your database credentials. For instance, SQL Server has its own sign-in and authentication system that is sometimes used. If the database administrator gave you a unique sign-in to the database, you might need to enter those credentials on the Database tab.

Functions can be nested within other functions, which can be useful for creating complex workflows. For example, you can create a function that performs data cleansing, and then nest that function within a function that performs data transformation.

When a user selects a new value for a parameter, it triggers a refresh of the report, updating the visuals and calculations based on the new value. This can help users quickly and easily explore different scenarios and analyze data in more detail.

An app is a collection of preset, ready-made visuals and reports that are shared with an entire organization. Using an app is like microwaving a TV dinner or ordering a fast-food value meal: you just have to press a few buttons or make a few comments, and you're quickly served a collection of entrees designed to go together, all presented in a tidy, ready-to-consume package.

Azure Pipelines
Pipelines rely on resources such as environments, service connections, agent pools, variable groups, and secure files. Checks enable the resource owner to control if and when a stage in any pipeline can consume a resource. As an owner of a resource, you can define checks that must be satisfied before a stage consuming that resource can start.

Your Excel files might exist in one of the following locations:
SharePoint - Team Sites - Saving your Power BI Desktop files to SharePoint Team Sites is similar to saving to OneDrive for Business. The main difference is how you connect to the file from Power BI. You can specify a URL or connect to the root folder.

An important and enabling part of Power BI is the multitude of data connectors that are included. Whether the data you want is in Excel or a Microsoft SQL Server database, in Azure or Oracle, or in a service like Facebook, Salesforce, or MailChimp, Power BI has built-in data connectors that let you easily connect to that data, filter it if necessary, and bring it into your dataset.

After the database has been connected to Power BI Desktop, the Navigator window displays the data that is available in your data source (the SQL database in this example). You can select a table or entity to preview its contents and make sure that the correct data will be loaded into the Power BI model.

Azure Pipelines
A stage can consist of many jobs, and each job can consume several resources. Before the execution of a stage can begin, all checks on all the resources used in that stage must be satisfied. Azure Pipelines pauses the execution of a pipeline prior to each stage, and waits for all pending checks to be completed.

SQL
SELECT * FROM SALES

The wildcard character (*) will import all characters from within the Sales table. This method isn't recommended because it will lead to redundant data in your model, which will cause performance issues and require extra steps to normalize your data for reporting.

Azure Pipelines
A pipeline is made up of stages. A pipeline author can control whether a stage should run by defining conditions on the stage. Another way to control if and when a stage should run is through approvals and checks.

Functions are reusable blocks of code that can be used to automate repetitive tasks in Power Query. You can create custom functions to perform specific tasks and then reuse them across multiple queries.

Upside
In private equity, funds and investors seek out underperforming or undervalued companies that they can take private and turn around, before going public years later. Buyout firms are involved in management buyouts (MBOs), in which the management of the company being purchased takes a stake. They often play key roles in leveraged buyouts, which are buyouts that are funded with borrowed money.
