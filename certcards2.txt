Victim
A victim is a target against whom attacks are initiated, vulnerabilities are exploited, or capabilities are used. It can be organizations, people, or assets, such as target email or IP addresses, domains, and so on.

In the process a user is redirected to the Box web app in a browser where they log in and authorize the application access to their data before they are redirected back to the applications redirect_url. This last step requires the application to be running on a web server somewhere accessible to the user.

Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER)
	Format designed to transfer syntax for data structures
		A very specific encoding format

The infrastructure includes the physical or logical communication structures such as IP or e-mail addresses, domain names, and others, employed by an adversary to deliver a capability.

If an API has not been properly developed or tested, an attacker may be able to find a vulnerability that wouldn’t be able to use the functionality of the application, but it might be able to cause the application to fail. This would be a denial of service attack, and it would then prevent anyone else from gaining access to that application

To achieve better control in terms of Orchestrator performance, the Specific Data size of queue items is limited to 1 MB with the help of the Queue.MaxSpecificDataSizeInKiloBytes app setting. Anything beyond this limit cannot be added to a queue, and it returns the 403 - Payload Too Large error code.

If you configured multiple redirect URIs for the application, the authorization URL must include the redirect_uri parameter matching one of the URIs configured in the Box developer console. If the parameter is not specified, the user will see a redirect_uri_missing error and will not be redirected back to the app after granting application access.

One method used by attackers to be able to intercept and perhaps even change this API information, is an on-path attack. This is when the attacker sits in the middle of the conversation and is able to view all of the traffic going back and forth, and in many cases modify or replay some of the traffic it has seen in these API calls. This means that an attacker can sit in the middle of the conversation, get an understanding of the way the API operates, and then put their own data into the API flows.

The theory of the Diamond Model
This methodology underlines the relationships and characteristics of four components of the diamond—adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim. These four core elements are connected to delineate the relationship between each other which can be analytically examined to further uncover insights and gain knowledge of malicious activities.

When setting a Deadline or a Postpone date for an Orchestrator transaction, we recommend populating the respective fields with relative dates. For example, DateTime.Now.AddHours(2), DateTime.Now.AddDays(10) and DateTime.Now.Add(New System.TimeSpan(5, 0, 0, 0)). Additionally, you can use the US notation to add an exact time, such as 10/10/2019 07:40:00. Automatic correction of this date is available, for example, if you write 12 10 2019 9:0, it is automatically transformed to 12/10/2019 09:00:00.

Vertical Privilege Escalation
Vertical privilege escalation, also known as privilege elevation, is a term used in cybersecurity that refers to an attack that starts from a point of lower privilege, then escalates privileges until it reaches the level of the user or process it targets.




38
Security+
Horizontal Privilege Escalation
Horizontal privilege escalation means that a user will achieve access permissions belonging to another user that owns the same access level as the user that has started the cyberattack. It is a bit more challenging compared to vertical ones since they require a deep understanding of how operating systems work.
