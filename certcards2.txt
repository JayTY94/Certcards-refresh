Many of our managed switches can be used to control broadcasts. There’s functionality within the software of the switch itself that allows us to limit the number of broadcasts that can be sent in any particular second. Some of these switches can even provide control of multicast, and unicast as well.

The snow bunting is a sexually dimorphic, medium-sized passerine bird. This passerine is a ground-dwelling species that walks, runs and could potentially jump if needed.[7] It measures 15 cm with a wingspan of 32–38 cm (13–15 in) and weights 30 to 40 grams.[8][7][14] The bill is yellow with a black tip, and is all black in summer for males.

Code Signing is similar to the process we use to provide encryption certificates on web servers. We first need a trusted certificate authority who’s going to sign the developer’s public key. The developer will then use their private key to digitally sign any code that they happen to be deploying. That means that you can validate that this code is exactly what was deployed by the original developer, by validating it with their public key.

Horizontal Privilege Escalation
Horizontal privilege escalation means that a user will achieve access permissions belonging to another user that owns the same access level as the user that has started the cyberattack. It is a bit more challenging compared to vertical ones since they require a deep understanding of how operating systems work.

Daemon
A program which is often started at the time the system boots and runs continuously without intervention from any of the users on the system. The daemon program forwards the requests to other programs (or processes) as appropriate.

Windows, for example, refers to daemons and System Agents and services.
