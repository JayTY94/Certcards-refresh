Confusion
Confusion means that each binary digit (bit) of the ciphertext should depend on several parts of the key, obscuring the connections between the two.[2]
The property of confusion hides the relationship between the ciphertext and the key.
Confusion increases the ambiguity of ciphertext and it is used by both block and stream ciphers.

Security +
Diffusion
Diffusion means that if we change a single bit of the plaintext, then about half of the bits in the ciphertext should change, and similarly, if we change one bit of the ciphertext, then about half of the plaintext bits should change.[3] This is equivalent to the expectation that encryption schemes exhibit an avalanche effect.

Tokenization is the process of exchanging sensitive data for nonsensitive data called “tokens” that can be used in a database or internal system without bringing it into scope.  

Although the tokens are unrelated values, they retain certain elements of the original data commonly length or format so they can be used for uninterrupted business operations. The original sensitive data is then safely stored outside of the organization’s internal systems.

Data loss prevention (DLP) is a set of tools and processes used to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an approach to networking that uses software-based controllers or application programming interfaces (APIs) to communicate with underlying hardware infrastructure and direct traffic on a network.

This model differs from that of traditional networks, which use dedicated hardware devices (i.e., routers and switches) to control network traffic. SDN can create and control a virtual network – or control a traditional hardware – via software.

The Definition of Done (DoD) is a concise list of technical criteria - from six to twelve items - that each Product Backlog item must meet in order to be considered potentially releasable to a new, or existing, customer.
