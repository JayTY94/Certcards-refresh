MS Teams
When you invite a guest to Teams, a guest account is created for them in Azure Active Directory and they are covered by the same compliance and auditing protection as other Microsoft 365 users. Guest access is subject to Azure AD and Microsoft 365 service limits.

Accounting
Under the accrual method, revenue is accounted for when it is earned. Unlike the cash method, the accrual method records revenue when a product or service is delivered to a customer with the expectation that money will be paid in the future. In other words, money is accounted for before it’s received. Likewise, expenses for goods and services are recorded before any cash is paid out for them2

Accounting
Under the cash method, revenue is reported on the income statement only when cash is received. Expenses are recorded only when cash is paid out. The cash method is typically used by small businesses and for personal finances2

Power BI
An app combines related content, like dashboards, spreadsheets, datasets, and reports, all in one place. An app has one or more of each content type bundled together. There are many ways a designer can share an app.

Data Transformation: Operational data usually needs to be transformed into suitable structure and format for analysis, often as part of an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process; though increasingly a variation in which you extract, load, and transform (ELT) the data is used to quickly ingest the data into a data lake and then apply "big data" processing techniques to transform it

Data consolidation is the process of combining data that has been extracted from multiple data sources into a consistent structure - usually to support analytics and reporting.

Azure Data Engineer
Operational data is usually transactional data that is generated and stored by applications, often in a relational or non-relational database. Analytical data is data that has been optimized for analysis and reporting, often in a data warehouse.

Streaming data refers to perpetual sources of data that generate data values in real-time, often relating to specific events. Common sources of streaming data include internet-of-things (IoT) devices and social media feeds.

Data pipelines are used to orchestrate activities that transfer and transform data. Pipelines are the primary way in which data engineers implement repeatable extract, transform, and load (ETL) solutions that can be triggered based on a schedule or in response to events.

The idea with a data lake is to store everything in its original, untransformed state. This approach differs from a traditional data warehouse, which transforms and processes the data at the time of ingestion.

A data warehouse is a centralized repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. Data warehouses store current and historical data in relational tables that are organized into a schema that optimizes performance for analytical queries.

Eidetic memory, also known as photographic memory and total recall, is the ability to recall an image from memory with high precision—at least for a brief period of time—after seeing it only once and without using a mnemonic device1. The term eidetic comes from the Greek word εἶδος (eidos) meaning "visible form"1.

Microsoft Data Analyst
Data analysis is the process of identifying, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover meaningful and useful information. The data is then crafted into a story through reports for analysis to support the critical decision-making process.

To analyze data, core components of analytics are divided into the following categories:

	Descriptive
	Diagnostic
	Predictive
	Prescriptive
	Cognitive




3
Microsoft Data Analyst
Descriptive analytics help answer questions about what has happened based on historical data. Descriptive analytics techniques summarize large datasets to describe outcomes to stakeholders.

By developing key performance indicators (KPIs), these strategies can help track the success or failure of key objectives.




4
Microsoft Data Analyst
Generally, diagnostic analytics occurs in three steps:

	Identify anomalies in the data. These anomalies might be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.

	Collect data that's related to these anomalies.

	Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.




5
Microsoft Data Analyst
Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened. Diagnostic analytics techniques supplement basic descriptive analytics, and they use the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of these events. Then, performance indicators are further investigated to discover why these events improved or became worse.

Microsoft Data Analyst
Predictive analytics help answer questions about what will happen in the future. Predictive analysis techniques use historical data to identify trends and determine if they are likely to recur.

Microsoft Data Analyst
Prescriptive analytics help answer questions about which actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target. By using insights from prescriptive analytics, organizations can make data-driven decisions.

Microsoft Data Analyst
Prescriptive analytics techniques rely on machine learning as one of the strategies to find patterns in large datasets. By analyzing past decisions and events, organizations can estimate the likelihood of different outcomes.

shutil.move() is a function in the Python module shutil, which allows the user to perform advanced operations on system files and a collection of files. It moves a file or directory (source) to another location (destination) and returns the destination. It works by creating a copy of the source in the destination and deleting the original source, unless it is protected.

Cognitive analytics attempt to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases, and then add these findings back into the knowledge base for future inferences, a self-learning feedback loop.

Microsoft Data Analyst
Effective cognitive analytics depend on machine learning algorithms, and will use several natural language processing concepts to make sense of previously untapped data sources, such as call center conversation logs and product reviews.

Microsoft Data Analyst
Data scientists perform advanced analytics to extract value from data. Their work can vary from descriptive analytics to predictive analytics. Descriptive analytics evaluate data through a process known as exploratory data analysis (EDA). Predictive analytics are used in machine learning to apply modeling techniques that can detect anomalies or patterns.
