Python
The CRUD operations correspond almost one-to-one with SQL commands:

Create: INSERT
Read: SELECT
Update: UPDATE
Delete: DELETE
So, to modify existing data in SQL, you would use the UPDATE command.

Python
According to the HTTP specification, POST, PUT, and the less common PATCH requests pass their data through the message body rather than through parameters in the query string. Using Requests, you’ll pass the payload to the corresponding function’s data parameter.

data takes a dictionary, a list of tuples, bytes, or a file-like object.

Python
The response headers can give you useful information, such as the content type of the response payload and a time limit on how long to cache the response. To view these headers, access .headers:

>>> import requests

>>> response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
>>> response.headers
{'Server': 'GitHub.com',
...
'X-GitHub-Request-Id': 'AE83:3F40:2151C46:438A840:65C38178'}

import re

def replace_punctuations_and_spaces(input_string):
    # Define the pattern to match all punctuations and spaces
    pattern = r'[^\w]'
    # Replace all matched characters with an empty string
    result = re.sub(pattern, '', input_string)
    return result

Diffusers Library
Forward and Reverse Processes
In diffusion, the forward process gradually adds noise to data, following a fixed probabilistic schedule, and the reverse process learns to denoise the noisy data. Mathematically, the forward process models q(x_t | x_{t-1}), while the reverse learns p(x_{t-1} | x_t) to reconstruct images.





8
Diffusers Library
ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound)
A loss function that diffusion models optimize to maximize the likelihood of generating realistic data. ELBO breaks down the generative process into manageable steps, penalizing differences between real and generated data distributions, balancing reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.





9
Diffusers Library
Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
These equations describe how noise evolves over continuous time in diffusion models. By defining the noise dynamics, SDEs allow for modeling both forward (adding noise) and reverse (removing noise) processes as smooth, differential transformations.





10
Diffusers Library
Text-Guided Image-to-Image Translation: Adapt an image guided by a text prompt
    Pipeline: img2img
Text-Guided Image-Inpainting: Fill the masked part of an image given the image, the mask, and a text prompt
    Pipeline: inpaint

Diffusers Library
Variational Inference
A technique for approximating complex probability distributions by simpler ones. In diffusion models, variational inference approximates the posterior distribution of the reverse process, enabling computationally feasible training by simplifying the diffusion and denoising steps.





12
Diffusers Library
Markov Chain
A sequence of random variables where each state depends only on the previous one. In diffusion models, the noise addition process is modeled as a Markov chain, allowing controlled transitions from clear images to noisy ones and vice versa, simplifying the math for training.

MS Identity Platform
Authorization server - The Microsoft identity platform is the authorization server. Also called an identity provider or IdP, it securely handles the end-user's information, their access, and the trust relationships between the parties in the auth flow. The authorization server issues the security tokens your apps and APIs use for granting, denying, or revoking access to resources (authorization) after the user has signed in (authenticated).





14
MS Identity Platform
The parties in an authentication flow use bearer tokens to assure, verify, and authenticate a principal (user, host, or service) and to grant or deny access to protected resources (authorization). Bearer tokens in the Microsoft identity platform are formatted as JSON Web Tokens (JWT).





15
MS Identity Platform
ID token - ID tokens are sent to the client application as part of an OpenID Connect flow. They can be sent alongside or instead of an access token. ID tokens are used by the client to authenticate the user. To learn more about how the Microsoft identity platform issues ID tokens, see ID tokens in the Microsoft identity platform.





16
MS Identity Platform
Resource owner - The resource owner in an auth flow is usually the application user, or end-user in OAuth terminology. The end-user "owns" the protected resource (their data) which your app accesses on their behalf. The resources owners can grant or deny your app (the client) access to the resources they own. For example, your app might call an external system's API to get a user's email address from their profile on that system.





17
MS Identity Platform
OAuth versus OpenID Connect: The platform uses OAuth for authorization and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0, so the terminology and flow are similar between the two. You can even both authenticate a user (through OpenID Connect) and get authorization to access a protected resource that the user owns (through OAuth 2.0) in one request.





18
MS Identity Platform
Client - The client in an OAuth exchange is the application requesting access to a protected resource. The client could be a web app running on a server, a single-page web app running in a user's web browser, or a web API that calls another web API. You'll often see the client referred to as client application, application, or app.

Diffusers from Hugging Face
Batch Size: In torch, batch size (len(prompt)) controls the number of prompts processed together. For single-prompt processing, it’s set to 1, impacting memory and processing speed.





20
Diffusers from Hugging Face
AutoencoderKL (VAE): A part of diffusers, this component compresses images into a latent space for efficient computation and then decodes the generated latent representations back into image space.





21
Diffusers from Hugging Face
Guidance Scale: A float controlling adherence to the prompt, with higher values enforcing a stronger alignment to the prompt, while lower values allow more creativity in the output.





22
Diffusers from Hugging Face
Latent Space and Latent Noise: The initial noise, generated with torch.randn, creates latents that represent the starting point in the latent space. This noise is progressively denoised to form the final image.





23
Diffusers from Hugging Face
Scheduler (UniPCMultistepScheduler): A diffusers module that controls the denoising steps of the diffusion process, determining how the image progressively refines with each step toward the prompt.





24
Diffusers from Hugging Face
Prompt Embedding and Conditioning: transformers’ CLIPTokenizer and CLIPTextModel embed both prompt and “unconditioned” input (empty string), allowing flexible control over how strongly the model adheres to the prompt.





25
sklearn
Assuming that some data is Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) is making the assumption that all samples stem from the same generative process and that the generative process is assumed to have no memory of past generated samples.





26
sklearn
When the cv argument is an integer, cross_val_score uses the KFold or StratifiedKFold strategies by default, the latter being used if the estimator derives from ClassifierMixin.

from sklearn import metrics
scores = cross_val_score(
    clf, X, y, cv=5, scoring='f1_macro')
scores
array([0.96..., 1.  ..., 0.96..., 0.96..., 1.        ])





27
sklearn
permutation_test_score: This function assesses model performance by computing a baseline distribution of scores via label permutation, creating a null hypothesis benchmark. Comparing the model’s score to this distribution reveals whether its performance is significant or due to random chance.





28
sklearn
The cv_results_ attribute contains useful information for analyzing the results of a search. It can be converted to a pandas dataframe with df = pd.DataFrame(est.cv_results_). The cv_results_ attribute of HalvingGridSearchCV and HalvingRandomSearchCV is similar to that of GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, with additional information related to the successive halving process.





29
sklearn
When evaluating the resulting model it is important to do it on held-out samples that were not seen during the grid search process: it is recommended to split the data into a development set (to be fed to the GridSearchCV instance) and an evaluation set to compute performance metrics.





30
sklearn
The classes in sklearn.neighbors can handle either NumPy arrays or scipy.sparse matrices as input. For dense matrices, a large number of possible distance metrics are supported. For sparse matrices, arbitrary Minkowski metrics are supported for searches.

Azure Functions
Reasons to choose WebJobs over Azure Functions

You have specific customizations that you want to make to the JobHost that aren't supported by Azure Functions.
You want to control your app's retry policies.
WebJobs only supports C# on Microsoft Windows.





32
Azure Functions
By default, functions have a timeout of five (5) minutes. This timeout is configurable to a maximum of 10 minutes. If your function requires more than 10 minutes to execute, you can host it on a VM. Additionally, if your service is initiated through an HTTP request and you expect that value as an HTTP response, the timeout is further restricted to 2.5 minutes.





33
Azure Functions
Monitor: This pattern implements a recurring process in a workflow, possibly looking for a change in state. For example, you could use this pattern to poll until specific conditions are met.





34
Azure Functions
Human interaction: This pattern combines automated processes that also involve some human interaction. A manual process within an automated process is tricky because people aren't as highly available and as responsive as most computers. You can incorporate human interaction using timeouts and compensation logic that runs if the human fails to interact correctly within a specified response time.





35
Azure Functions
You can use three durable function types: Client, Orchestrator, and Activity.
Client functions are the entry point for creating an instance of a Durable Functions orchestration. They can run in response to an event from many sources, such as a new HTTP request arriving, a message being posted to a message queue, an event arriving in an event stream. You can write them in any of the supported languages.





36
Azure Functions
Durable Functions is an extension of Azure Functions that lets you perform long-lasting, stateful operations in Azure. Using this approach, you get all the benefits of a serverless hosting model while letting the Durable Functions framework take care of activity monitoring, synchronization, and runtime concerns.

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service for running containerized applications. With AKS, you can take advantage of managed add-ons and extensions for additional capabilities while preserving the broadest level of configurability. For more information, see AKS documentation.





39
AKS
Azure Container Apps is a fully managed Kubernetes-based application platform that helps you deploy HTTP and non-HTTP apps from code or containers without orchestrating infrastructure. For more information, see Azure Container Apps documentation.





40
AKS
AKS is commonly used to host multiple workloads or disparate workload components. You can isolate these workloads and components by using Kubernetes native functionality, like namespaces, access controls, and network controls, to meet security requirements.





41
AKS
AKS also provides access to the Kubernetes API server, which enables you to customize the container orchestration and thus deploy projects from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Consequently, there's a significant learning curve for workload teams that are new to Kubernetes.





42
AKS
Although AKS offers the most customization, it demands greater operational input. In contrast, PaaS solutions like Container Apps and Web App for Containers let Azure handle tasks like OS updates.

Dataverse Plugins
The PluginType entity in Dataverse stores metadata about registered plugins. It includes information such as the plugin's unique identifier (plugintypeid), name, assembly details, and the class implementing the plugin logic. By querying the plugintypes entity via the Web API, developers can retrieve information about specific plugins, facilitating management and debugging of custom business logic.





50
Dataverse Plugins
Error Handling in Dataverse involves interpreting and managing error messages returned by the system during operations. Errors can arise from validation failures, plugin restrictions, permission issues, or data conflicts. Effective error handling requires understanding error codes, messages, and contextual details provided by the system. This enables developers to debug issues, enforce business rules, and provide meaningful feedback to users or calling applications.





51
Dataverse Plugins
API Permissions and Scopes define what operations an application can perform and what data it can access within an API like Dataverse Web API. During Azure AD application registration, permissions are granted (e.g., user_impersonation) to control access levels. Scopes specify the exact permissions requested during the authentication process. Proper configuration ensures that applications have the necessary access without over-privileging, adhering to the principle of least privilege for security.





52
OData
Delta Queries allow clients to track changes (additions, deletions, updates) and synchronize data efficiently without retrieving the entire dataset each time. This feature optimizes performance and reduces bandwidth usage by enabling incremental data synchronization.





53
OData
Navigation Links are URLs that provide access to related entities or collections within an OData service. They facilitate navigation between related entities, enabling clients to traverse relationships and retrieve associated data seamlessly.





54
OData
Complex Types are structured data types in OData that group multiple related properties into a single reusable structure. They allow for more organized and modular data models by encapsulating related data, such as addresses or contact information.

65
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker images are large files that are initially stored on your PC, and we need tools to manage these files.

The Docker CLI and Docker Desktop allow us to manage images by building, listing, removing, and running them. We manage Docker images by using the docker client. The client doesn't execute the commands directly, and sends all queries to the dockerd daemon.





66
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker images are stored and made available in registries. A registry is a web service to which Docker can connect to upload and download container images. The most well-known registry is Docker Hub, which is a public registry. Many individuals and organizations publish images to Docker Hub, and you can download and run these images using Docker running on your desktop, on a server, or in the cloud.





67
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker containers provide security features to run multiple containers simultaneously on the same host without affecting each other. As we learned, we can configure both data storage and network configuration to isolate our containers or share data and connectivity between specific containers.





68
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A registry is organized as a series of repositories. Each repository contains multiple Docker images that share a common name and generally the same purpose and functionality. These images normally have different versions, identified with a tag. This mechanism enables you to publish and retain multiple versions of images for compatibility reasons.





69
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
If you need to terminate the container, use the kill command to send a kill signal. The container's kernel captures the kill signal, but the running process doesn't. This command forcefully terminates the working process in the container.

Lastly, to remove containers that are in a stopped state, use the remove command. After removing a container, all data stored in the container gets destroyed.

107
Finance Junk
Discretionary Coupons on AT1 Bond: The coupons on an AT1 Bond are not guaranteed; banks can cancel coupon payments without defaulting, allowing them to conserve capital during financial stress.





108
Finance Junk
Difference from Traditional Convertibles in AT1 Bond: Unlike standard convertible bonds where conversion is optional, an AT1 Bond undergoes mandatory conversion or write-down if the issuer’s financial health declines below specified thresholds.





109
Finance Junk
Regulatory Purpose of AT1 Bond: Introduced under Basel III, an AT1 Bond is designed to help banks absorb losses without resorting to taxpayer-funded bailouts, thus strengthening their capital buffers.





110
Finance Junk
Definition of AT1 Bond: An AT1 Bond (Additional Tier 1 Bond), also known as a “CoCo” bond, is a hybrid security issued by banks that can convert into equity or have principal written down if certain financial thresholds are breached.





111
Finance Junk
Subordination of AT1 Bond: An AT1 Bond is deeply subordinated, sitting just above common equity in a liquidation hierarchy, resulting in higher risk and higher yields compared to more senior debt.

118
Taxes
Purpose: The Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) helps the U.S. government identify persons who may be using foreign financial accounts to circumvent U.S. law and trace funds used for illicit purposes or identify unreported income maintained or generated abroad.





119
Taxes
U.S. persons, including citizens, residents, corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, trusts, and estates, must file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) if they meet the reporting threshold.





120
Taxes
Quarterly Due Dates: Pass-Through Entities (PTEs) often have quarterly estimated tax payment requirements. For example, in California, qualifying Pass-Through Entities (PTEs) may elect to pay an entity-level state tax on income, with payments typically due on or before June 15th and the due date of the original return without regard to extensions.





121
Taxes
State-Specific Rules: Different states have different rules and deadlines for Pass-Through Entities (PTEs). For instance, in Hawaii, the Pass-Through Entity (PTE) tax must be paid by the original due date of the return, which for calendar year taxpayers is April 20th following the close of the taxable year.





122
Taxes
Pass-Through Entities (PTEs) include business structures like partnerships and S corporations. The income, deductions, and credits pass through to the individual owners or shareholders, who then report these on their personal tax returns.





123
Taxes
The main differences between an S Corp and a C Corp fall into three major categories: formation, taxation, and ownership. Generally, taxes are the biggest and most important difference. C Corps are subject to corporate tax rates, while S Corps allow for pass-through taxation, meaning owners report the business profits and losses on their personal income tax returns.

PEP 8
Alias Imports Judiciously: Use the as keyword to create aliases for long module names or to resolve naming conflicts. Ensure that aliases are clear and widely recognized (e.g., import numpy as np) to maintain code readability and consistency.





137
PEP 8
No Spaces Inside Brackets: Do not add spaces inside parentheses, brackets, or braces. This rule applies to function calls, indexing, and data structures. Correct formatting ensures consistency and prevents syntax errors.

python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]





138
PEP 8
Use Parentheses for Multi-Line Imports: When importing multiple objects from a module, enclose them within parentheses and list each on a separate line. This enhances readability and adheres to line length restrictions without using backslashes.





139
PEP 8
Spaces Around Binary Operators: Place one space on both sides of binary operators (e.g., =, +, -, ==). This spacing makes expressions clearer and easier to read. For example:

python
total = price + tax





140
PEP 8
Handle Import Errors Gracefully: When dealing with optional dependencies, use try-except blocks to handle ImportError exceptions. This prevents the entire application from crashing if an optional module isn't available, allowing for more robust and flexible code.





141
PEP 8
Use __all__ to Define Public API: In your modules, define the __all__ list to explicitly specify which objects are public and should be imported when using from module import *. This controls the module's public interface and prevents unintended namespace pollution.





142
Python
More coding languages are supported in TensorFlow than in PyTorch, which has a C++ API. You can use TensorFlow in both JavaScript and Swift. If you don’t want to write much low-level code, then Keras abstracts away a lot of the details for common use cases so you can build TensorFlow models without sweating the details.





143
Python
In Python, special methods support comparison operators.

For example, the .__lt__() method supports the < operator, .__gt__() supports >, and the .__eq__() method supports the == operator.

These methods allow you to define custom behavior for comparison operations in your custom classes.





144
Python
Because the decoding of bytes to a str requires an encoding scheme, Requests will try to guess the encoding based on the response’s headers if you don’t specify one. You can provide an explicit encoding by setting .encoding before accessing .text:

>>> response.encoding = "utf-8"  # Optional: Requests infers this.
>>> response.text
'{"current_user_url":"https://api.github.com/user", ...}'





145
Python
You can enhance the input functionality by importing the readline module.

This module provides advanced input capabilities, such as command-line editing and history recall, by overriding the standard input processing and registering handlers for keyboard input.





146
Python
On UNIX-like systems, readline is part of Python’s standard library, so you don’t need to install anything. On modern Windows versions, you don’t even need to work with readline because these advanced editing capabilities are already built into the console natively.





147
Python
In computer programming jargon, a heisenbug is a software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior when one attempts to study it.[1] The term is a pun on the name of Werner Heisenberg, the physicist who first asserted the observer effect of quantum mechanics, which states that the act of observing a system inevitably alters its state.





148
Diffusers Library
Reverse Diffusion
The inverse process where an image is generated by removing noise, step-by-step, from an initial noisy state. This approach is essential in diffusion models, reconstructing data by "reversing" the diffusion process and achieving high-quality image outputs.





149
Diffusers Library
There are three main components of the library to know about:
Many different schedulers - algorithms that control how noise is added for training, and how to generate denoised images during inference.





150
Diffusers Library
Classifier-Free Guidance
A technique allowing diffusion models to generate images without an external classifier, enhancing flexibility in output. This guidance uses the model's own internal structure to fine-tune the output, improving realism without the need for additional label constraints.





151
Diffusers Library
Score Matching
A method to train models by estimating the gradient of data probability density (the "score") at each noise level. By approximating this gradient, the model learns to shift noisy data towards regions of higher probability, ultimately leading to denoised, realistic images.





152
Diffusers Library
Likelihood Estimation
The process of calculating the probability of the data under the model's parameters. In diffusion models, maximizing this likelihood means finding parameters that make the observed data most probable, allowing for a better approximation of complex data distributions.





153
Diffusers Library
Denoising Process
The step-by-step refinement in diffusion models where the model removes noise from a random input, progressing towards an image. At each step, the model estimates the noise in the image and subtracts it, gradually enhancing coherence and detail.





154
MS Identity Platform
If your desktop or mobile application runs on Windows and on a machine connected to a Windows domain (Active Directory or Microsoft Entra joined) it is possible to use the Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) to acquire a token silently. No UI is required when using the application.





155

156
Diffusers from Hugging Face
Tokenizer (CLIPTokenizer): Provided by transformers, it converts input text into token IDs. These numerical representations allow the model to process the prompt and understand its meaning.





157
Diffusers from Hugging Face
Text Encoder (CLIPTextModel): Also from transformers, the text encoder turns tokenized text into embeddings that represent the semantic meaning of the prompt, guiding image generation to reflect the prompt.





158
Diffusers from Hugging Face
Device Management: In torch, models and data are moved to the GPU (CUDA) with .to(torch_device), enabling faster processing by taking advantage of parallel GPU computations.





159
Diffusers from Hugging Face
UNet (UNet2DConditionModel): In diffusers, UNet iteratively removes noise from the latent representation, gradually shaping random noise into an image aligned with the text prompt.





160
sklearn
Data leakage occurs when information from the test set inadvertently influences the model during training, leading to overly optimistic performance. Cross-validation methods that respect data structure, like LeavePGroupsOut or TimeSeriesSplit, help prevent this risk.

from sklearn import metrics
scores = cross_val_score(
    clf, X, y, cv=5, scoring='f1_macro')
scores
array([0.96..., 1.  ..., 0.96..., 0.96..., 1.        ])

Azure Functions
Fan out/fan in: This pattern runs multiple functions in parallel and waits for all the functions to finish. You can aggregate the results of the parallel executions or use them to compute a final result.





162
Azure Functions
Durable Functions allows you to define stateful workflows using an orchestration function. An orchestration function provides these extra benefits:
You can define the workflows in code. You don't need to write a JSON description or use a workflow design tool.
Functions can be called both synchronously and asynchronously. Output from the called functions is saved locally in variables and used in subsequent function calls.





163
Azure Functions
Async HTTP APIs: This pattern addresses the problem of coordinating state of long-running operations with external clients. An HTTP call can trigger the long-running action, then redirect the client to a status endpoint. The client can learn when the operation is finished by polling this endpoint.





164
Azure Functions
2. Suppose your Azure Function has a blob trigger associated with it and you want it to execute only when png images are uploaded. Which of the following blob trigger Path values should you use? 

samples-workitems/{name}.png
The Path tells the blob trigger where it should monitor for changes, and if there are any filters applied. Adding a file extension to the Path specifies that uploaded files must have that file extension in order for the trigger to invoke the function.

samples-workitems/{name}.png
The Path tells the blob trigger where it should monitor for changes, and if there are any filters applied. Adding a file extension to the Path specifies that uploaded files must have that file extension in order for the trigger to invoke the function.





165
Azure Functions
You can use three durable function types: Client, Orchestrator, and Activity.





166
Azure Functions
Activity functions are the basic units of work in a Durable Functions orchestration. An activity function contains the actual work performed by the tasks being orchestrated.

175
OData
Metadata in OData describes the structure, data types, relationships, and other aspects of the data model. The $metadata endpoint provides the service’s data model and schema definitions using CSDL, essential for understanding available entities and their relationships.





176
OData
An ETag is a mechanism for concurrency control in OData, representing a version identifier for a resource. It ensures that updates or deletions are performed on the correct version of a record, preventing conflicts and maintaining data integrity.





177
OData
A Polymorphic Association is a relationship where an entity can be associated with multiple types of other entities. It requires the use of @odata.type to identify the specific type of related entities, enabling flexible and dynamic associations within the data model.





178
OData
Inheritance Hierarchies allow entities to derive properties and behaviors from parent entities, enabling reuse and polymorphism. Managed in Dataverse using OData's @odata.type, they allow clients to interact with a hierarchy of related entity types effectively.





179
OData
A Delta Token is a marker used in Delta Queries to track changes since the last query. Clients use delta tokens to request only the changes (additions, deletions, updates) that have occurred since their last synchronization, optimizing data retrieval.





180
OData
The @odata.type annotation specifies the exact entity type or derived type being referenced in an OData payload. It is crucial for handling inheritance and polymorphism by informing clients about the specific type of an entity for correct deserialization and processing.





181

Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
To place a container in the run state, use the run command. You can also restart a container that's already running. When restarting a container, the container receives a termination signal to enable any running processes to shut down gracefully before the container's kernel terminates.





188
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker provides us with the docker stats command. This command returns information for the container such as percentage CPU usage, percentage memory usage, I/O written to disk, network data sent and received, and process IDs assigned. This information is useful as an immediate data stream; however, no aggregation is done, because the data isn't stored. We'd have to install third-party software for meaningful data capture over a period of time.





189
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Container storage drives are less performant.

Containers implement a storage driver to allow your apps to write data. This driver introduces an extra abstraction to communicate with the host OS kernel, and is less performant than writing directly to a host filesystem.

Containers can make use of two options to persist data. The first option is to make use of volumes, and the second is bind mounts.





190
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
For more advanced scenarios, both Linux and Windows provide additional network options. For example, the overlay option creates a virtual switch from the host network, so containers on that network can get IP addresses from DHCP servers or operate with IP addresses from that network segment. Furthermore, Docker allows third-party vendors to create network plugins.





191
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
The host network enables you to run the container on the host network directly. This configuration effectively removes the isolation between the host and the container at a network level.

Keep in mind that the container can use only ports the host isn't already using.





192
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
1. A container is launched using the --publish 8080:80 flag. Which of the following options is the most likely network configuration used for the container? 
The Bridge network configuration is an internal, private network used by the container and isolates the container network from the Docker host network. We use the publish flag to map ports between the container and host ports.
