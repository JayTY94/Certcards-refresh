Azure Key Vault Secrets
Key Vault also supports a contentType field for secrets. Clients may specify the content type of a secret to help interpreting the secret data when it's retrieved. The maximum length of this field is 255 characters. The suggested usage is as a hint for interpreting the secret data. For instance, an implementation may store both passwords and certificates as secrets, then use this field to differentiate.

Azure Resource Providers are essentially services within the Azure ecosystem that manage specific types of Azure resources. When you interact with Azure, whether through the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, REST APIs, or SDKs, you're often dealing with these resources. Each resource provider specializes in a particular category of resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, etc.

To make a test module executable in unittest, you can add the following code to the end of the module:
