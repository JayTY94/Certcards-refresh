Realizable Value Principle: This indicates that Assets should normally not be shown on the Balance Sheet at a value greater than they can bring to the company if sold. If the original historical cost for example is $5,000, and the maximum that the company can sell that Asset for today is $4,000, this Asset should be shown on the Balance Sheet at the lower amount because of this principle.

In an XML document or external entity, a CDATA section is a piece of element content that is marked up to be interpreted literally, as textual data, not as marked up content.[1] A CDATA section is merely an alternative syntax for expressing character data; there is no semantic difference between character data in a CDATA section and character data in standard syntax where, for example, "<" and "&" are represented by "&lt;" and "&amp;", respectively.

Going Concern Principle: THis principle assumes that ac company will continue in business into the future. Without this assumption, most of the accounting information could not be presented in the Financial Statements since we are alwasy amking assumptions (e.g. what the life of a Long-Term Asset is).

Accounting
Materiality Principle: This principle states that an item should only be included on the Balance aSheet if it would change any decisions of a statement user. For example, a multimillion dollar donating $100 to charity, this information would not change any decision that management or the owner would make. The expense should be recorded under "miscellaneous expense"

Historical Cost Principle: According to this rule, most Assets and Liabilities should be represented on the Balance Sheet at the amount that was paid to acquire the Asset, or for the Liabilities, at the amount that was contracted to be paid in the future. No account is taken for either inflation or changing value of the Assets over time.
