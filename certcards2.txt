Azure Files Documentation
Azure file shares use the Kerberos protocol to authenticate with an identity source. When an identity associated with a user or application running on a client attempts to access data in Azure file shares, the request is sent to the identity source to authenticate the identity.





124
Azure Files Documentation
The procedures for changing the size, cost, and performance characteristics for Azure File Shares are different for classic file shares, which use the Microsoft.Storage resource provider, versus file shares created with Microsoft.FileShares (preview).





125
Azure Files Documentation
# Create the Kerberos key on the storage account and get the Kerb1 key as the password for the AD identity 
# to represent the storage account
$ResourceGroupName = "<resource-group-name-here>"
$StorageAccountName = "<storage-account-name-here>"

New-AzStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $StorageAccountName -KeyName kerb1
Get-AzStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $StorageAccountName -ListKerbKey | where-object{$_.Keyname -contains "kerb1"}





126
Azure Files Documentation
To register your storage account with AD DS, you create a computer account (or service logon account) representing it in your AD DS. Think of this process as if it were like creating an account representing an on-premises Windows file server in your AD DS.





127
Azure Files Documentation
Azure Files supports identity-based authentication for Windows file shares over Server Message Block (SMB) using the Kerberos authentication protocol through the following methods:

    On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
    Microsoft Entra Domain Services
    Microsoft Entra Kerberos for hybrid user identities

C# Basics
What is the role of namespaces in C#?

C#: Namespaces organize classes, structs, and other types into logical groups.
Example:
using System;
using System.Linq;





130
C# Basics
How do basic data types work in C#?

C#: Statically typed, types must be explicitly declared.
Example:
int x = 10;  
string y = "Hello";





131
C# Basics
Indexers allow objects to be indexed like arrays. They enable you to access elements in an object using the array-like syntax.
Example:
public class Student {
    private string[] grades = new string[3];

    public string this[int index] {
        get { return grades[index]; }
        set { grades[index] = value; }
    }
}

pfSense
If administrators activate the Netgate Service and Support widget on the pfSense software GUI Dashboard, pfSense software will query Netgate servers to obtain the current support status, a list of web links, and other information to help administrators make the best use of their support options. This query occurs no more than once every 24 hours.





133
pfSense
The name of a FreeBSD interface starts with the name of its network driver. It is then followed by a number starting at 0 that increases incrementally by one for each additional interface sharing that driver. For example, a common driver used by Intel gigabit network interface cards is igb. The first such card in a firewall will be igb0, the second is igb1, and so on.





134
pfSense
In networking, A DMZ is an area where public servers are reachable from the Internet via the WAN but isolated from the LAN. The DMZ keeps the systems in other segments from being endangered if the network is compromised, while also protecting hosts in the DMZ from other local segments and the Internet in general.





135
pfSense
For several essential and optional services, such as checking for updates, installing updates and packages, and the Auto Config Backup service, pfSense® software makes outgoing connections to servers owned and operated by Netgate.





136
pfSense
pfSense software also transmits a unique and random “device key” to privately identify which backups belong to a given installation.

This device key must be unique to each firewall backing up its configuration. To do this the key is automatically generated by taking the SHA256 hash of the SSH service keys on the installation. This allows ACB to reliably and properly identify ownership of each backup in an anonymous way.

Power BI
Q: Why is a 200 K-row table (40 MB PBIX) unlikely to be “too large” for Power BI Desktop?
A: Power BI regularly handles multi-million-row tables under 100 MB if well-modeled; a 200 K-row table is small. Performance issues usually stem from query complexity or broken folding, not raw size.





193
Power BI
Q: Why might using a Date dimension table improve model performance and simplify filters?
    A:

    A dedicated Date table lets you create one‐to‐many relationships to fact tables and use date‐intelligence DAX functions efficiently.

    It centralizes filters (e.g., Year, Quarter) rather than filtering on a date column in every fact, reducing the complexity of DAX queries that run during refresh or visual rendering.





194
Power BI
Q: What are common pitfalls when manually partitioning with two queries?
A: Forgetting to disable History after its catch-up refresh (causes full pull), mismatched schemas between History & Recent, and letting the Historical table outgrow available memory.





195
Power BI
Q: What role does Data Profiling in Power Query play when troubleshooting refresh issues?
A:

    Data Profiling (enable under View → Column quality/Column distribution) lets you see values, error rates, and distinct counts.

    Helps identify unexpected nulls, data type mismatches, or outliers that could increase transformation complexity or break folding.





196
Power BI
What pattern lets you reference intermediate calculations by name when building a calculated table?
Use a two-step ADDCOLUMNS approach: first add your intermediate columns, then in a second ADDCOLUMNS call reference those names to compute further results (for example, percentages).

Microsoft Purview
Because a Sensitivity Label is stored in clear text in the metadata for files and emails, third-party apps and services can read it and then apply their own protective actions, if required.





223
Microsoft Purview
Sensitivity labels provide users and admins with visibility into the sensitivity of the data that they're using, and the labels themselves can apply protection actions that include encryption, access restrictions, and visual markings.





224
Microsoft Purview
As you work with Data Map and Unified Catalog, keep these points in mind:

    All data in Data Map and Unified Catalog is metadata, not the underlying data itself.
    None of the permissions or roles in Data Map or Unified Catalog provide access to underlying data itself.





225
Microsoft Purview
Extend SharePoint protection when files are downloaded when you configure a default sensitivity label for SharePoint document libraries and select the option to extend protection for unencrypted files. Then, when these files are downloaded, the current SharePoint permissions travel with the labeled file.

Templates are used to add new staff without having to repeatedly enter the same basic information. Enter default options in profile templates to decrease the time required to create staff. See Setting Up Staff Templates for more information.





234
CCH Axcess
Providing Access Through Staff Attributes
Granting access by organizational unit or position allows for less maintenance, but gives less precise control. Including or excluding some staff in various groups may be required. An advantage of granting access through attributes is that new staff or staff whose attributes change are automatically granted access according to their organizational unit or position.





235
CCH Axcess
Enter a client or staff ID, or a client or staff name in the Search box above the grid. Enter the complete criteria to search for specific records or partial information to search for similar matches.

    Name refers to the sort name saved in the client or staff profile.
    You can search for the client ID and sub ID by adding periods to the search string. For example, find client ID 123 with sub ID 001 by entering 123.001 in the Search box.





236

305
Power BI
Q: How can Aggregations in Power BI speed up queries on large fact tables?
    A:

    Define a summarized (aggregated) table at a higher grain (e.g., daily sales totals) and point visuals to it for common queries.

    The engine stores both the detailed and aggregated tables; for queries that can be satisfied by the aggregate, Power BI never scans the full fact table, reducing query time dramatically.





306
Power BI
Q: Why might switching to the Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector improve performance over the SQL connector?
A: The Dataverse connector is designed to leverage server‐side paging and API optimizations, often preserving query folding more reliably and avoiding TDS‐related throttling.





307
Power BI
Q: What are the two main components of query execution time when pulling data via SQL?
A: Fixed costs (connection setup, query plan, authentication, network latency) and variable costs (reading/transmitting each row). Reducing row count cuts the variable portion.





308
Power BI
Q: What is the effect of data type mismatches on Power Query folding and performance?
    A:

    If you change a column’s data type (e.g., from text to date) before filtering, Power Query may break folding because the source might not support that conversion natively.

    Always apply type conversions at the end, after filters, or ensure the source can natively convert the type in the same query.

Microsoft Purview
You can configure your policies so that, when a DLP policy is triggered, email notifications are sent automatically, and policy tips are shown to admins and end users. Policy tips are useful ways to raise awareness of risky behaviors on sensitive items and train users to avoid those behaviors in the future.





509
Microsoft Purview
DLP policies are how you monitor the activities that users take on sensitive items at rest, sensitive items in transit, or sensitive items in use and then take protective actions. For example, when a user attempts a prohibited action, like copying a sensitive item to an unapproved location or sharing medical information in an email, DLP can:

show a pop-up policy tip to the user that warns them that they might be trying to share a sensitive item inappropriately





510
Microsoft Purview
Publish the labels. After your sensitivity labels are configured, publish them by using a label policy. Decide which users and groups should have the labels and what policy settings to use. A single label is reusable—you define it once, and then you can include it in several label policies assigned to different users.

Power BI
Q: What are the risks of using a static RangeStart parameter over a long period?
A: If you never update RangeStart, new “late-arriving” or back‐dated changes older than that date won’t be captured. You risk permanently missing updates unless you periodically advance the boundary.





541
Power BI
Q: Name one alternative to the SQL connector when connecting to Dataverse that can improve folding and avoid timeouts.
A: Use the built-in Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector via Get Data → Dataverse. It often auto-folds better into Dataverse’s paging model than the SQL (TDS) endpoint.





542
Power BI
Q: How do incremental refresh policies handle late-arriving data, and what can you do to mitigate missed updates?
    A:

    Incremental refresh typically uses a RangeStart/RangeEnd window; any rows older than RangeStart aren’t re-queried.

    To capture late-arriving updates, include a “stale data window” (e.g., overlapping dates) so you reprocess recent partitions that might receive back‐dated changes, then drop duplicates in Power Query or DAX.





543
Power BI
Q: What is “query folding” and why does it matter for refresh timeouts?
A: Query folding means pushing filtering/sorting logic down to the data source. If a step breaks folding, Power Query pulls all rows client-side, increasing data volume and risking timeouts.





544
Power BI
Q: What is the typical Power BI Service behavior when you define an Incremental Refresh policy but deploy to a Pro workspace?
A: The service ignores the policy and performs a full‐table refresh each time, without partitioning.

The basic syntax for a string template in JavaScript uses backticks (`) and ${} for embedding expressions.
  const name = 'Jay';
  const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Jay!





577
JavaScript Concepts
With Boolean(value) you can convert any value to a boolean. There is a fixed set of values, so called falsy values, that convert to false. Most importantly, false, 0, empty string, null, undefined and NaN are falsy.
Boolean(-1);// => true
Boolean(0);// => false
Boolean(' ');// => true
Boolean('');// => false





578
JavaScript Concepts

579
JavaScript Concepts
When ... appears on the right-hand side of an assignment, it's known as the spread operator. It expands an array into a list of elements. Unlike the rest element, it can appear anywhere in an array literal expression, and there can be more than one.

    const oneToFive = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const oneToTen = [...oneToFive, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    oneToTen;
    // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

You can back up your Azure file share via share snapshots, which are read-only, point-in-time copies of your share. Snapshots are incremental, meaning they only contain as much data as has changed since the previous snapshot. You can have up to 200 snapshots per file share and retain them for up to 10 years.
