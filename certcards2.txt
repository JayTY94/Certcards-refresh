Occasionally, you might find that your data sources contain null values. For example, a freight amount on a sales order mgiht have a null value if it's synonymous with zero. If the value stays null, the averages will not calculate correctly. One solution would be to change the nulls to zero, which will produce the more accurate freight average.

In a Power BI Desktop model design, which type of object do you create to enforce row-level security? 

  Role
  A role consists of one or more rules, which are DAX formulas that are used to filter table rows. Roles define row-level security.
  NOT
  Table
  Column
  Measure

Authentication method(s) for SQL Server databases in Power BI:
Database - Use your database credentials. For instance, SQL Server has its own sign-in and authentication system that is sometimes used. If the database administrator gave you a unique sign-in to the database, you might need to enter those credentials on the Database tab.

When you append queries, you'll be adding rows of data to another table or query. For example, you could have two tables, one with 300 rows and another with 100 rows, and when you append queries, you'll end up with 400 rows. When you merge queries, you'll be adding columns from one table (or query) into another. To merge two tables, you must have a column that is the key between the two tables.

In what order does an analytic query implement its phases? 

Filter, Group, Summarize
Filter is used to first restrict the data to query. Group then divides the query result into groups. Summarize then produces single value aggregations for each group.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding a star schema design? 
  Fact tables store accumulations of business events, like sales orders or currency exchange rates.
  NOT
  Fact tables store accumulations of business entities.
  Fact tables must have a unique column.

Fields is a collective term that is used to describe a model resource that can be used to configure a visual. The three different model resources that are fields include:

Columns
Hierarchy levels
Measures

In Azure Analysis Services, the compatibility level refers to release-specific behaviors in the Analysis Services engine. For example, DirectQuery and tabular object metadata have different implementations depending on the compatibility level. In-general, you should choose the latest compatibility level supported by your platform.

On the Home tab on the Power Query Editor ribbon, select the drop-down list for Append Queries. You can select Append Queries as New, which means that the output of appending will result in a new query or table, or you can select Append Queries, which will add the rows from an existing table into another.





35

A best practice is to evaluate the column data types in Power Query Editor before you load the data into a Power BI data model. If you determine that a data type is incorrect, you can change it. You might also want to apply a format to the values in a column and change the summarization default for a column.

 What can you do to improve performance when you're getting data in Power BI? 

Remove unnecessary columns and rows
Correct. Always use the least amount of data needed for your project.





37
Microsoft Data Analyst
In an Analytic Query, Summarizing produces a single value result. Typically, numeric columns are summarized by using summarization methods (sum, count, and many others). More complex summarizations, like a percent of grand total, can be achieved by defining measures that are written in DAX.





38
Microsoft Data Analyst
In an Analytic Query, filtering, or slicing, targets the data of relevance. In Power BI reports, filters can be applied to three different scopes: the entire report, a specific page, or a specific visual. Filtering is also applied in the background when row-level security (RLS) is enforced.

Microsoft Data Analyst
It's good practice to change uncommon or unhelpful query names to names that are more obvious or that the user is more familiar with. For instance, if you import a view, the view might have a name that contains a prefix of v, such as vProduct. People might find this name unclear and confusing, so you might want to remove the prefix.

A fiscal year is a period of 12 consecutive months chosen by a business or organization for financial reporting purposes. It may or may not correspond to a calendar year. For example, a company might choose to have its fiscal year begin on July 1 and end on June 30 of the following year.

2. If you have two queries that have different data but the same column headers, and you want to combine both tables into one query with all the combined rows, which operation should you perform? 

Append
  Correct. Append will take two tables and combine it into one query. The combined query will have more rows while keeping the same number of columns.
Merge
Combine Column

Some organizations use fiscal years for tax purposes. For example, the federal government's fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. This means that when the government passes its annual budget, it is for the upcoming fiscal year, not the upcoming calendar year.

A progress bill is a credit against WIP. The progress bill amount appears on the client’s invoice but does not relieve any WIP. Instead, it adds to the client’s balance due. When you finally bill the client’s WIP, you will apply the progress amount against the WIP to reach the net balance due.

You develop a Power BI model in Power BI Desktop, and once published to a workspace in the Power BI service, it’s then known as a dataset. A dataset is a Power BI artifact that’s a source of data for visualizations in Power BI reports and dashboards.

Microsoft Data Analyst
Not all datasets originate from models developed in Power BI Desktop. Some datasets represent connections to external-hosted models in AAS or SSAS. Others can represent real-time data structures, including push datasets, streaming datasets, or hybrid datasets. This module is concerned only with models developed in Power BI Desktop.

Table storage mode settings determine the model framework, which can be either import, DirectQuery, or composite. The following units in this module describe each of these frameworks and provides guidance on their use.

An import model comprises tables that have their storage mode property set to Import.
A DirectQuery model comprises tables that have their storage mode property set to DirectQuery, and they belong to the same source group. Source group is described later in this module.
A composite model comprises more than one source group.

Power BI imposes limits on how often scheduled refresh operations can occur. It’s up to eight times per day in a shared capacity, and up to 48 times per day in a dedicated capacity.






5
Microsoft Data Analyst
Power BI imposes dataset size restrictions, which limit the size of a model. When you publish the model to a shared capacity, there’s a 1-GB limit per dataset. When this size limit is exceeded, the dataset will fail to refresh. 



6
Microsoft Data Analyst
When you publish an import model to a dedicated capacity (also known as Premium capacities), it can grow beyond 10-GB, providing you enable the Large dataset storage format setting for the capacity.

By default, to refresh a table, Power BI removes all data and reloads it again. These operations can place an unacceptable burden on source systems, especially for large fact tables. To reduce this burden, you can set up the incremental refresh feature. Incremental refresh automates the creation and management of time-period partitions, and intelligently update only those partitions that require refresh.
