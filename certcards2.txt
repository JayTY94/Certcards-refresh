Confusion
Confusion means that each binary digit (bit) of the ciphertext should depend on several parts of the key, obscuring the connections between the two.[2]
The property of confusion hides the relationship between the ciphertext and the key.
Confusion increases the ambiguity of ciphertext and it is used by both block and stream ciphers.

Software Diversity
	Alternative compiler paths would result in a different binary each time
		Each compiled application would be a little different, but functionality would be the same.
	An attack against different binaries would only be successful on a fraction of users
		An attacker wouldn't know what exploit to use

IDS is primarily focused on evaluating attacks based on attack signatures and audit trails. An A-signature-based IDS will monitor packets on the network and compare them against a database of signatures or attributes from known malicious threats. This is similar to the way most antivirus software detects malware.

SYN attacks exploit the TCP three-way handshake and overload the servers, resulting in authorized users being denied access to network resources. The attacker uses a spoofed IP address not in use on the Internet and sends multiple SYN packets to the target machine.

TCP session hijacking is a technique that involves intercepting a TCP session initiated between two machines in order to hijack it. The initial authentication is performed by the legitimate machine. Later, the hacker who wishes to launch this attack takes control of the connection throughout the duration of the session.

In an XML document or external entity, a CDATA section is a piece of element content that is marked up to be interpreted literally, as textual data, not as marked up content.[1] A CDATA section is merely an alternative syntax for expressing character data; there is no semantic difference between character data in a CDATA section and character data in standard syntax where, for example, "<" and "&" are represented by "&lt;" and "&amp;", respectively.
