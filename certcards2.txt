24
FSLogix
Profile Container:
A core FSLogix component that encapsulates the entire user profile in a VHD/VHDX file. This approach improves logon/logoff times and reduces issues associated with traditional roaming profiles by loading a single container instead of numerous individual files.





25
FSLogix
VHD/VHDX:
Virtual hard disk file formats used by FSLogix Profile Containers to store user profiles. They are optimized for efficient I/O operations and are crucial for fast loading times in virtual environments.





26
FSLogix
Q: What does the FSLogix Profile Container do when a user is logging into multiple Azure Virtual Desktops (AVD)?
A: FSLogix mounts the same Profile Container (VHDX) to any virtual desktop the user logs into, ensuring that their profile settings, documents, and application preferences are consistent and immediately available across all virtual machines. This provides a unified experience regardless of which VM the user accesses.





27
FSLogix
Q: Where are FSLogix Profile Containers typically stored in Azure Virtual Desktop environments?
A: FSLogix Profile Containers are typically stored in Azure Files or network shares (SMB share) to allow consistent access across different virtual desktop sessions.





28
FSLogix
Antivirus Software Exclusions for FSLogix Container Files:
A best practice in FSLogix deployments. It involves configuring antivirus software to exclude FSLogix container files (both Profile and Office Containers stored in VHD/VHDX format) from scanning. This prevents potential performance degradation and issues during file access.





29
FSLogix

Front: What are tagged templates and how do you use them?

Back: Tagged templates allow you to parse template literals with a function. The function receives the template string and the values as arguments.
  function tag(strings, ...values) {
  console.log(strings); // Array of string segments
  console.log(values);  // Array of values
  return 'Tagged template result';
}
const result = tag`Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(result); // Output: Tagged template result

Power BI
Q: Why is a 200 K-row table (40 MB PBIX) unlikely to be “too large” for Power BI Desktop?
A: Power BI regularly handles multi-million-row tables under 100 MB if well-modeled; a 200 K-row table is small. Performance issues usually stem from query complexity or broken folding, not raw size.





202
Power BI
Q: What is VertiPaq and why is it relevant when appending tables?
A: VertiPaq is Power BI’s in‐memory columnar engine. When appending tables with identical schemas, VertiPaq compresses and merges columns efficiently, making the in‐memory append step very fast.





203
Power BI
Q: What tool in Power BI Desktop lets you see which query steps are folding, how long each step takes, and row counts?
A: Query Diagnostics (in Power Query Editor → Tools → Start Diagnostics / Stop Diagnostics).





204
Power BI
Q: How can you increase the SQL connector’s command timeout in M?
A: In the Sql.Database(...) step, add CommandTimeout=#duration(0,0,20,0) (for 20 minutes), e.g.:

m
Source = Sql.Database("server", "db", [ Query="...", CommandTimeout=#duration(0,0,20,0) ])





205
Power BI
Q: What is the effect of data type mismatches on Power Query folding and performance?
    A:

    If you change a column’s data type (e.g., from text to date) before filtering, Power Query may break folding because the source might not support that conversion natively.

    Always apply type conversions at the end, after filters, or ensure the source can natively convert the type in the same query.





206
Power BI
Q: If you freeze only half your rows (e.g., 100 K of 200 K), what kind of refresh time improvement can you expect?
A: Roughly a proportional gain—halving the pulled rows typically cuts variable query time nearly in half; speed-up may be ~40 % overall because fixed overhead (connection setup) remains.





207
Power BI
Q: What are the two main components of query execution time when pulling data via SQL?
A: Fixed costs (connection setup, query plan, authentication, network latency) and variable costs (reading/transmitting each row). Reducing row count cuts the variable portion.





208
Power BI
What’s the difference between SUMMARIZE and SUMMARIZECOLUMNS?
SUMMARIZE creates a virtual table using a row context that you must convert to filter context with CALCULATE, whereas SUMMARIZECOLUMNS works directly in filter context, handles aggregations and filter modifiers more predictably, and is optimized by the engine for better performance.





209
Power BI
Q: How do you use Performance Analyzer in Power BI Desktop?
A: In Report view, go to View → Performance Analyzer → Start Recording → Refresh Visuals. It shows DAX query times, visual rendering times, etc., for each visual.





210
Power BI
Q: How can using the “Enable Load of Related Entities” option in the Dataverse connector improve performance?
    A:

    This option, in the Dataverse (OData) connector, fetches related lookup or option‐set tables alongside the main entity in one API call.

    Reduces the number of round trips, preserves folding, and can significantly cut down on refresh time compared to separately querying each related table.





211
Power BI
Why can’t you reference a newly added column alias in the same SUMMARIZECOLUMNS call?
DAX processes each expression in a single SUMMARIZECOLUMNS call in isolation, so the engine doesn’t know aliases until after all expressions are parsed. You must either inline the logic or add the column in a separate step.





212
Terraform Codebox
Process segmentation fault (Segmentation fault (core dumped))
An error that occurs when a program tries to access memory it shouldn’t. Often caused by running a binary built for the wrong OS or architecture (e.g., FreeBSD binary on Linux).





213
Terraform Codebox
/tmp directory
A temporary directory used for short-lived files. It's often cleared on reboot and used by installers, compilers, or cloud-init scripts to stage downloads and extracted files before moving them to permanent locations.

251
FSLogix
A full VHD(x) clone is performed when Cloud Cache determines, at sign in, that a storage provider isn't at the same sequence. During this operation, all pending writes are kept in the local cache until all storage providers are at the same sequence. Once complete, the flush operation begins sending new data to the storage providers.





252
FSLogix
During a first-time sign-in, FSLogix creates the container for the user in C:\ProgramData\FSLogix\Cache and mounts the container to the virtual machine. Next, FSLogix sets up all the necessary redirections for the user's profile. Then the User Profile Service creates the user's profile into the local cache.





253
FSLogix
Cloud Cache uses the concept of a proxy file, represented as Profile_%username%.vhd though it isn't a true VHD file. The proxy file is used as a means to collect and process all I/O writes destined for the local cache. The I/O writes are buffered in memory and tracked via the proxy file before they're written out as block-level cache objects in the cache directory.





254
FSLogix
Q: What is the role of Profile Disk Differencing in FSLogix?
A: Profile Disk Differencing allows FSLogix to create differencing VHDX disks, where changes to the user profile are stored in separate files, reducing the load on the main profile disk. This improves performance by ensuring faster read/write operations and reducing storage overhead.





255
FSLogix
On a lazy asynchronous operation, Cloud Cache flushes the changes to all storage providers simultaneously as each provider is flushed on its own thread. FSLogix doesn't throttle this operation and utilizes as much throughput as the system will allow.





256
FSLogix
Cloud Cache operates the user's profile from the local cache during the user's session and must be configured with one or more remote storage providers as specified in CCDLocations. These remote storage providers store copies of the local cache and are used during the current session and for subsequent sign ins.





257
FSLogix
Q: What is the main difference between FSLogix Profile Containers and traditional roaming profiles?
A: FSLogix uses VHDX containers to store user profiles, ensuring portability and faster logons, while traditional roaming profiles can become fragmented and inconsistent across multiple virtual machines.





258
FSLogix
SMB Share (Server Message Block):

    const play_set = new Set (playlist)
    return play_set.has(track)
  }





340
JavaScript Concepts
Unique Names: All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names, called identifiers. These names can be short (like x and y) or more descriptive (like age, sum, totalVolume). Identifiers can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but they must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign1.





341
JavaScript Concepts
To create a deep copy of an object in JavaScript, you can use the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object)) method. This approach works well for simple objects, such as those with string:number pairs, and ensures that the original object remains unmodified.





342
JavaScript Concepts
Component-Based Architecture: Building applications by encapsulating functionality into independent, reusable components, commonly used in frontend frameworks.

Power BI
Q: Why might a table visual in Power BI show fewer rows than exist in the dataset even if the data model has all rows?
A: Large table visuals can hit rendering timeouts or be partially truncated. Use Performance Analyzer to see if the DAX query or visual rendering is timing out.





424
Power BI
Q: What indicates a break in query folding when reviewing Query Diagnostics in Power Query?
A: In the “Folding” diagnostic table, any step marked “Not foldable” shows where folding stopped, meaning subsequent transformations happen client‐side.





425
Power BI
Q: Name one alternative to the SQL connector when connecting to Dataverse that can improve folding and avoid timeouts.
A: Use the built-in Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector via Get Data → Dataverse. It often auto-folds better into Dataverse’s paging model than the SQL (TDS) endpoint.





426
Power BI
Q: What are the risks of using a static RangeStart parameter over a long period?
A: If you never update RangeStart, new “late-arriving” or back‐dated changes older than that date won’t be captured. You risk permanently missing updates unless you periodically advance the boundary.





427
Power BI
Q: How can Aggregations in Power BI speed up queries on large fact tables?
    A:

    Define a summarized (aggregated) table at a higher grain (e.g., daily sales totals) and point visuals to it for common queries.

    The engine stores both the detailed and aggregated tables; for queries that can be satisfied by the aggregate, Power BI never scans the full fact table, reducing query time dramatically.





428
Power BI
What is the difference between row context and filter context in DAX?
Row context iterates over rows (as in iterators like SUMX or SUMMARIZE), while filter context filters tables for evaluation (as in measures and visuals). CALCULATE is the primary way to convert row context into filter context and apply or modify filters.





429
Power BI
Q: Why might using a Date dimension table improve model performance and simplify filters?
    A:

    A dedicated Date table lets you create one‐to‐many relationships to fact tables and use date‐intelligence DAX functions efficiently.

    It centralizes filters (e.g., Year, Quarter) rather than filtering on a date column in every fact, reducing the complexity of DAX queries that run during refresh or visual rendering.





430
Power BI
Q: Why might switching to the Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector improve performance over the SQL connector?
A: The Dataverse connector is designed to leverage server‐side paging and API optimizations, often preserving query folding more reliably and avoiding TDS‐related throttling.

Power BI
Q: What is “query folding” and why does it matter for refresh timeouts?
A: Query folding means pushing filtering/sorting logic down to the data source. If a step breaks folding, Power Query pulls all rows client-side, increasing data volume and risking timeouts.





432
Power BI
How does ALLEXCEPT work in a measure?
ALLEXCEPT(table, column1, …) removes all filters on the specified table except those on the listed columns. It’s used inside CALCULATE to preserve only certain filters (for example, keep EngagementID but ignore Task Category).





433
Power BI
Q: How do incremental refresh policies handle late-arriving data, and what can you do to mitigate missed updates?
    A:

    Incremental refresh typically uses a RangeStart/RangeEnd window; any rows older than RangeStart aren’t re-queried.

    To capture late-arriving updates, include a “stale data window” (e.g., overlapping dates) so you reprocess recent partitions that might receive back‐dated changes, then drop duplicates in Power Query or DAX.

Terraform Codebox
In a Terraform module, names like "main" or "this" are user-defined labels for a resource block. They are not reserved words — you can choose meaningful names to reference resources elsewhere in your config.


hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "this" { ... }
# Reference: azurerm_storage_account.this.name





435

436
Terraform Codebox
Shebang (#!/bin/bash)
The first line in many shell scripts, it tells the system which interpreter to use (e.g., bash). Required in cloud-init scripts if you’re writing inline scripts to ensure consistent behavior.





437
Terraform Codebox
Data sources in Terraform let you read existing cloud resources without managing them. You use them when you want to reference things created outside of Terraform.


hcl
data "azurerm_client_config" "current" {}





438
Terraform Codebox
Bastion Host is a secure jump box VM that provides SSH access to private resources. Not required for public VMs but useful in production setups.





439
Terraform Codebox
Terraform provider blocks declare which cloud or service you're configuring. You must include a provider block like azurerm in the root module, even if the actual resources are defined in submodules.


hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  use_cli = true
}





440
Terraform Codebox
ARM Template vs Terraform: Both are infrastructure-as-code for Azure, but Terraform is multi-cloud, more modular, and readable. ARM is native to Azure and more verbose.





441
Terraform Codebox
The templatefile() function loads a local file and injects variables, often used to populate dynamic scripts, like cloud-init.


hcl
templatefile("${path.module}/cloud-init.yaml.tpl", {
  share_name = var.share_name
})





442
Terraform Codebox
VS Code Remote - SSH extension allows you to edit files and run terminals directly inside a remote VM. Great when you can’t install tools locally.





443
Terraform Codebox
The terraform.tfvars file allows you to define values for input variables. It’s automatically loaded during terraform plan or terraform apply, so you don’t have to pass variables via CLI every time.


hcl
ssh_public_key_path = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
allowed_ssh_cidr    = "192.168.1.0/24"





444
Terraform Codebox
path.module in Terraform refers to the directory containing the module being evaluated. It is used when loading template files (e.g., cloud-init.yaml.tpl) from the same folder.


hcl
templatefile("${path.module}/cloud-init.yaml.tpl", {...})





445
Terraform Codebox
Out of Memory (OOM) condition
Occurs when a VM exceeds its allocated RAM and has no swap space, potentially leading to process termination or a system hang. Common on small instances when running memory-heavy operations.





446
Terraform Codebox
The cloud-init mechanism in Azure allows Terraform to provision the VM on first boot, such as installing software, mounting storage, or configuring files.

Example inside VM block:

hcl
custom_data = base64encode(templatefile("${path.module}/cloud-init.yaml.tpl", {...}))





447
Terraform Codebox
runuser vs sudo vs su

sudo: Run a command as another user (usually root) with elevated privileges.

su: Switches to another user session entirely.

runuser: Preferred in scripts and cloud-init to run a single command as another user without opening a full session.





448
Terraform Codebox
The base64encode() function is used in Terraform to convert the rendered cloud-init template into the format expected by the custom_data field of a VM resource.





449

FSLogix
All data written to the user's profile is temporarily stored as block-level cache objects in the same directory. Those block-level cache objects are then committed to the local cache. Before the block-level cache objects are created, the writes into the user's profile are processed in memory through a proxy file.





473

FSLogix Application Masking:
A component of FSLogix used to control application visibility. It isolates and hides applications (and their dependencies) from users who should not access them, based on group policies, thereby simplifying desktop environments.





474
FSLogix
Cloud Cache uses the locally mounted container to provide periodic updates to the remote storage providers. Cloud Cache is designed to insulate users from short-term or intermittent local (inner-region, close proximity) storage issues.





475
FSLogix
Q: What is FSLogix App Masking, and how does it relate to managing applications in virtual desktops?
A: FSLogix App Masking is a feature that allows administrators to control which applications are visible to which users in a virtual desktop environment. This "masks" applications based on user roles, ensuring that users only see the apps they have permissions for, without the need for separate application installations.





476
FSLogix
Cloud Cache uses storage providers based on the order of entries in CCDLocations.
Storage providers should be listed in order of proximity, then preference.
Only one (1) provider is used when data is hydrated from the storage provider.





477
FSLogix
FSLogix Agent Log:
A log file generated by the FSLogix agent that provides detailed diagnostic information. It is crucial for troubleshooting issues related to mounting Profile Containers and other FSLogix operations.





478
FSLogix
Data is written to all storage providers regardless of which provider is used during data hydration.
Performance (latency, utilization, bottlenecks) of a storage provider affects its sync status with the local copy.
Having one (1) or more provider that is behind in updates from local cache could be an indicator of an under performing storage provider.





479
FSLogix
Multi-Session Environment:
A setup where multiple users share the same operating system instance (typical of RDS and multi-session AVD deployments). This environment requires special considerations—such as the use of a Redirector Driver—to handle concurrent access and prevent file locking issues.





480
FSLogix
When the local cache doesn't contain the data requested by the file system, Cloud Cache hydrates (reads and copies) the data from 1 of the remote storage providers to the local cache. This operation is also part of the sign in process when populating the local cache for the user's profile.

JavaScript Concepts
When ... appears on the right-hand side of an assignment, it's known as the spread operator. It expands an array into a list of elements. Unlike the rest element, it can appear anywhere in an array literal expression, and there can be more than one.

    const oneToFive = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const oneToTen = [...oneToFive, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    oneToTen;
    // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

JavaScript Concepts
Callback functions are functions passed as arguments. This programming pattern creates a sequence of function calls in both synchronous and asynchronous programming. Writing a callback function is no different from writing a function; however, the callback function must match the signature defined by the calling function.





549
JavaScript Concepts
Ensure to use the comparison operator === instead of the assignment operator = when comparing values in switch cases. In an exercise, I had something like 
    case converted_value = 0
instead of
    case converted_value === 0
and that screwed up all of the following cases.





550
JavaScript Concepts
Many operators coerce the operands into numbers (if necessary) according to the logic of the Number function explained above.

    Relational operators (for non-string operands): >, >=, <, <=
    Bitwise operators: |, &, ^, ~





551
JavaScript Concepts
Type Coercion to boolean commonly occurs for
    the condition of an if statement
    the first operand of the ternary operator ?
    the operand of the logical NOT operator !
    the operands of the logical AND && and OR || operators (the result of the expression is one of the operands, not necessarily a boolean)

608
Microsoft Purview
In Microsoft Purview, you implement data loss prevention by defining and applying DLP policies. A DLP policy can help you identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive data-at-rest, data-in-motion, and data-in-use. DLP policies act on a variety of locations, methods of data transmission, and types of user activities.





609
Microsoft Purview
Run the policy in simulation mode, without Policy Tips and then use the DLP reports, and any incident reports, to assess the impact of the policies. You can use DLP reports to view the number, location, type, and severity of policy matches. Based on the results, you can fine-tune your policies as needed.

Publish the labels. After your sensitivity labels are configured, publish them by using a label policy. Decide which users and groups should have the labels and what policy settings to use. A single label is reusable—you define it once, and then you can include it in several label policies assigned to different users.





612
Microsoft Purview
Data understanding is about ensure data has quality descriptors that help users understand what the data is and how it should be used.





613
Microsoft Purview
Microsoft Purview comes with preconfigured DLP templates for Financial, Medical and health, and Privacy policy templates. Additionally, you can build your own using the Custom template. As you design and create your actual DLP policies, having a working knowledge of the sensitive items you need to protect helps you choose the right sensitive information type.





614
Microsoft Purview
Create the labels. Create and name your sensitivity labels according to your organization's classification taxonomy for different sensitivity levels of content. Use common names or terms that make sense to your users. You can then use sublabels to group similar labels by category.





615
Microsoft Purview
After you create a DLP policy, it's stored in a central policy store and then synced to the various content sources, including:

DAX
KEEPFILTERS can outperform FILTER(...) for simple column predicates.
For straight column comparisons (e.g. Dim[Category] = "X"), KEEPFILTERS often lets the engine optimize better than wrapping a FILTER() over the entire table.





625
DAX
KEEPFILTERS makes filters additive (intersecting) instead of replacing.
By default, CALCULATE(…, Column = Value) replaces any existing filter on Column. Wrapping that predicate in KEEPFILTERS forces DAX to intersect it with whatever filters are already in place.





626
Pandas
What is the difference between pivot() and pivot_table()?

pivot() reshapes data but requires unique combinations of index/columns.

pivot_table() allows for aggregation when there are duplicates and is more flexible.

Enter a client or staff ID, or a client or staff name in the Search box above the grid. Enter the complete criteria to search for specific records or partial information to search for similar matches.

    Name refers to the sort name saved in the client or staff profile.
    You can search for the client ID and sub ID by adding periods to the search string. For example, find client ID 123 with sub ID 001 by entering 123.001 in the Search box.





636
CCH Axcess
The Export Grid option exports up to 20,000 records from all pages of the Client Manager Quick Search results. For the Staff Manager Quick Search, only the current page of results are exported with this option. 

That behavior seems really inconsistent to me.

Q: Why might “Rows Loaded” in Refresh History show fewer rows than expected even when the status is “Succeeded”?
A: A query may have partially timed out or a partition returned 0 rows (e.g., due to filter/timeout). “Succeeded” can hide warnings about QueryTimeout or skipped partitions.

Q: What is the default command timeout for the SQL Server connector in Power Query?
A: 10 minutes. Queries taking longer will time out unless you explicitly increase the CommandTimeout in the M step.

Why might SUMMARIZECOLUMNS yield better performance than SUMMARIZE?
The Tabular engine has built-in optimizations for SUMMARIZECOLUMNS that reduce temporary table materializations and merge identical aggregations, resulting in faster query plans, especially on large fact tables.

When would you use GENERATESERIES in DAX?
GENERATESERIES(start, end, increment) produces a single-column table of numeric values at the specified step size. It’s useful for creating bins or ranges (for example, percentage buckets) for frequency analysis.

What’s the scope of variables (VAR) inside an ADDCOLUMNS column definition?
A VAR declared inside one column’s definition lives only within that column. To share results, you must either repeat the logic or separate the columns into multiple ADDCOLUMNS calls so that the column values exist in the table.

Q: What are common pitfalls when manually partitioning with two queries?
A: Forgetting to disable History after its catch-up refresh (causes full pull), mismatched schemas between History & Recent, and letting the Historical table outgrow available memory.

What pattern lets you reference intermediate calculations by name when building a calculated table?
Use a two-step ADDCOLUMNS approach: first add your intermediate columns, then in a second ADDCOLUMNS call reference those names to compute further results (for example, percentages).

Q: What role does Data Profiling in Power Query play when troubleshooting refresh issues?
A:

    Data Profiling (enable under View → Column quality/Column distribution) lets you see values, error rates, and distinct counts.

    Helps identify unexpected nulls, data type mismatches, or outliers that could increase transformation complexity or break folding.

Terraform Codebox
chmod 600
A command that sets file permissions to read/write for the owner only. Commonly used on sensitive files like SSH keys or swapfiles to prevent unauthorized access.





650
Terraform Codebox
Terraform allows you to target specific parts of your infrastructure using -target. This makes it possible to destroy or apply only a specific module like a VM while keeping persistent resources like storage intact.


bash
terraform destroy -target=module.ephemeral

Terraform Codebox
A cloud-init.yaml.tpl file is a template for provisioning Linux VMs. You use Terraform’s templatefile() function to inject variables and base64-encode it for the VM’s custom_data.





652
Terraform Codebox
The .terraform/ directory stores provider binaries and module cache for your Terraform project. It should never be committed to version control, as it may contain large files or local-only paths.

tar -xzf
A Unix command to extract .tar.gz (gzip-compressed tarballs). The flags mean x (extract), z (decompress), and f (use file). Commonly used to install binary packages like the Exercism CLI.





655

swapon / mkswap
mkswap formats a file to be used as swap space. swapon activates it, allowing the system to treat it like virtual memory. Useful on VMs with low RAM to avoid crashing during memory spikes.





658
Terraform Codebox
CIFS (Common Internet File System)
A network file-sharing protocol used by Windows and supported on Linux via cifs-utils. It's used in Azure File Shares to mount a remote storage directory into a Linux VM as if it were a local folder.

file command
Used to inspect the type of a file based on its content, not its extension. Helpful when downloading files with tools like curl to check whether a .tar.gz is really a binary or an HTML error page.

Terraform Codebox
SSH keys are used to securely authenticate to a VM. Terraform expects you to pass the public key path and inject it into the VM at creation, enabling key-based access instead of passwords.

Example in variables.tf:

hcl
variable "ssh_public_key_path" {
  default = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
}





663
Terraform Codebox
Terraform modules allow you to organize and reuse code. You can define a VM, network, or storage module once and use it in multiple places with different variables passed in.

Example root call:

hcl
module "ephemeral" {
  source = "./modules/ephemeral"
  vm_name = "devbox"
}
