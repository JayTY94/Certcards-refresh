Azure Key Vault Secrets
Key Vault also supports a contentType field for secrets. Clients may specify the content type of a secret to help interpreting the secret data when it's retrieved. The maximum length of this field is 255 characters. The suggested usage is as a hint for interpreting the secret data. For instance, an implementation may store both passwords and certificates as secrets, then use this field to differentiate.




113
sklearn
Neighbors-based regression can be used in cases where the data labels are continuous rather than discrete variables. The basic idea is that if point A is very distant from point B, and point B is very close to point C, then we know that points A and C are very distant, without having to explicitly calculate their distance.

You can design business process flows that tie together the rows for up to five different tables into a single process so that people using the app can focus on the flow of their process rather than on which table they are working in. They can more easily navigate between related table rows.




116
Azure Storage
Most Azure resources only work with Resource Manager, which makes it easy to decide which model to choose. However, storage accounts, virtual machines, and virtual networks support both, so you must choose one or the other when you create your storage account. The Resource Manager model adds the concept of a resource group, which isn't available in the classic model.

sklearn
The principle behind nearest neighbor methods is to find a predefined number of training samples closest in distance to the new point, and predict the label from these. The number of samples can be a user-defined constant (k-nearest neighbor learning), or vary based on the local density of points (radius-based neighbor learning).




126
Kaggle
Once we've identified the shape of the trend, we can attempt to model it using a time-step feature. We've already seen how using the time dummy itself will model a linear trend:
target = a * time + b

We can fit many other kinds of trend through transformations of the time dummy. If the trend appears to be quadratic (a parabola), we just need to add the square of the time dummy to the feature set, giving us:
target = a * time ** 2 + b * time + c

An Administrative user is a user who has access to the Settings and Administration features but has no access to any of the functionality. Use this account to assign administrative users to perform day-to-day maintenance functions (create user accounts, manage security roles, and so on). Because an administrative user doesn't have access to customer data nor any functionality, the user doesn't require a license (after setup).




157
DNS
- Same-Origin Policy (SOP)
Web browsers use the same-origin policy as a defense mechanism to restrict how websites from one origin can interact with other origins. The origin of a website is defined by the protocol (e.g., http://), domain (e.g., paloaltonetworks.com), and port (e.g., :80).




158
sklearn
The k-neighbors classification in KNeighborsClassifier is the most commonly used technique. The optimal choice of the value is highly data-dependent: in general a larger k suppresses the effects of noise, but makes the classification boundaries less distinct.




159
Python
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so replacing the "var" function with "std" is the best approach.

You could calculate the square roots of the existing pivot table data, but this complicates the code.




160
sklearn
Given enough time, K-means will always converge, however this may be to a local minimum. This is highly dependent on the initialization of the centroids. As a result, the computation is often done several times, with different initializations of the centroids. One method to help address this issue is the k-means++ initialization scheme, which has been implemented in scikit-learn (use the init='k-means++' parameter).




161
Python
In pandas, you have several methods at your disposal for data aggregation:

.pivot_table() is great for creating pivot tables that summarize data.

Azure Functions
A trigger is an object that defines a specific function. For example, if you want a function to execute every 10 minutes, you could use a timer trigger.

Every function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to execute a piece of logic that runs under multiple conditions, you need to create multiple functions that share the same core function code.

Azure Functions
Experimental APIs. If you use the Consumption plan, with Functions, you can make millions of calls and pay very little. One thing to keep in mind is that any type of storage incurs a cost.

An example is writing to a database with a function. This plan is ideal to use for prototyping or for Start-ups. In the latter case, if you have so many calls to your functions that most likely means you have paying customers. Hence, Azure Functions scales with your business. As your business grows, you might consider other hosting plans as well.

Azure Storage
A storage account represents a collection of settings like location, replication strategy, and subscription owner. You need one storage account for each group of settings that you want to apply to your data. The following illustration shows two storage accounts that differ in one setting (region); that one difference is enough to require separate storage accounts.

If there are data sources being accessed within the partition, and data flowing in from other partitions, the Firewall loses its ability to be the gatekeeper, since the data flowing in could be leaked to one of the internally accessed data sources without it knowing about it. Thus the Firewall prevents a partition that accesses other partitions from being allowed to directly access any data sources.
