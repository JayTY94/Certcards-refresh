Power BI
Why can’t you reference a newly added column alias in the same SUMMARIZECOLUMNS call?
DAX processes each expression in a single SUMMARIZECOLUMNS call in isolation, so the engine doesn’t know aliases until after all expressions are parsed. You must either inline the logic or add the column in a separate step.





46
Power BI
Q: How can you increase the SQL connector’s command timeout in M?
A: In the Sql.Database(...) step, add CommandTimeout=#duration(0,0,20,0) (for 20 minutes), e.g.:

m
Source = Sql.Database("server", "db", [ Query="...", CommandTimeout=#duration(0,0,20,0) ])





47
Power BI
Q: Why is a 200 K-row table (40 MB PBIX) unlikely to be “too large” for Power BI Desktop?
A: Power BI regularly handles multi-million-row tables under 100 MB if well-modeled; a 200 K-row table is small. Performance issues usually stem from query complexity or broken folding, not raw size.





48
Power BI
Q: What role does Data Profiling in Power Query play when troubleshooting refresh issues?
A:

    Data Profiling (enable under View → Column quality/Column distribution) lets you see values, error rates, and distinct counts.

    Helps identify unexpected nulls, data type mismatches, or outliers that could increase transformation complexity or break folding.





49
Power BI
Q: Why might switching to the Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector improve performance over the SQL connector?
A: The Dataverse connector is designed to leverage server‐side paging and API optimizations, often preserving query folding more reliably and avoiding TDS‐related throttling.





50
Power BI
Q: What is the effect of data type mismatches on Power Query folding and performance?
    A:

    If you change a column’s data type (e.g., from text to date) before filtering, Power Query may break folding because the source might not support that conversion natively.

    Always apply type conversions at the end, after filters, or ensure the source can natively convert the type in the same query.





51
Power BI
What’s the difference between SUMMARIZE and SUMMARIZECOLUMNS?
SUMMARIZE creates a virtual table using a row context that you must convert to filter context with CALCULATE, whereas SUMMARIZECOLUMNS works directly in filter context, handles aggregations and filter modifiers more predictably, and is optimized by the engine for better performance.





52
Power BI
Q: Why might “Rows Loaded” in Refresh History show fewer rows than expected even when the status is “Succeeded”?
A: A query may have partially timed out or a partition returned 0 rows (e.g., due to filter/timeout). “Succeeded” can hide warnings about QueryTimeout or skipped partitions.





53
Power BI
Q: What tool in Power BI Desktop lets you see which query steps are folding, how long each step takes, and row counts?
A: Query Diagnostics (in Power Query Editor → Tools → Start Diagnostics / Stop Diagnostics).





54
Power BI
What is the difference between row context and filter context in DAX?
Row context iterates over rows (as in iterators like SUMX or SUMMARIZE), while filter context filters tables for evaluation (as in measures and visuals). CALCULATE is the primary way to convert row context into filter context and apply or modify filters.





55
Power BI
When would you use GENERATESERIES in DAX?
GENERATESERIES(start, end, increment) produces a single-column table of numeric values at the specified step size. It’s useful for creating bins or ranges (for example, percentage buckets) for frequency analysis.

TSQL
Q: How do window functions differ from aggregate functions with GROUP BY?
A: Window functions (like SUM(...) OVER (...)) calculate values across sets of rows without collapsing them into a single row, preserving the full row data.





63
TSQL
Q: What does SUM(x) OVER (PARTITION BY y) do?
A: It sums the values of x for each group of rows where y has the same value, but keeps each row intact in the result set.





64
TSQL
Window Functions:

Functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), LEAD(), and LAG() perform calculations across sets of rows related to the current row without collapsing the result set.





65

SSH keys are used to securely authenticate to a VM. Terraform expects you to pass the public key path and inject it into the VM at creation, enabling key-based access instead of passwords.

Example in variables.tf:

hcl
variable "ssh_public_key_path" {
  default = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
}





78
Terraform Codebox
The terraform.tfvars file allows you to define values for input variables. It’s automatically loaded during terraform plan or terraform apply, so you don’t have to pass variables via CLI every time.

In a data loss prevention policy, you:

    Define the sensitive information you want to monitor for, like financial, health, medical, and privacy data.
    Where to monitor, like Microsoft 365 services or Windows and macOS devices.
    The conditions that must be matched for a policy to be applied to an item, like items containing credit card, driver's license, or social security numbers.
    The actions to take when a match is found, like audit, block the activity, and block the activity with override.





90
Microsoft Purview
Publish the labels. After your sensitivity labels are configured, publish them by using a label policy. Decide which users and groups should have the labels and what policy settings to use. A single label is reusable—you define it once, and then you can include it in several label policies assigned to different users.





91
Microsoft Purview
Create the labels. Create and name your sensitivity labels according to your organization's classification taxonomy for different sensitivity levels of content. Use common names or terms that make sense to your users. You can then use sublabels to group similar labels by category.

Python + Oauth2.0
http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

A built-in Python class that handles HTTP GET requests and serves files from the current directory. It can be subclassed to customize how requests are processed — like extracting query parameters or sending custom responses.





117
Python + Oauth2.0
global token_dict

Declares that `token_dict` is a global variable so it can be modified inside the `do_GET` method. This is where the access token and other OAuth metadata are stored after the token exchange.





118
Python + Oauth2.0
handler.wfile.write()

Writes raw bytes to the response body. In your code, it sends a message like “You may close this window” back to the browser after the authorization code is received.

Sends an HTTP POST request to the token endpoint with the authorization code and client credentials. If successful, it returns a JSON object containing the access token and other OAuth metadata.





120
Python + Oauth2.0
Authorization Code Flow

An OAuth 2.0 process where the user logs in via a browser, and the app receives a temporary code that it can exchange for an access token. This flow is secure because the client secret is never exposed during the initial login.





121
Python + Oauth2.0
socketserver.TCPServer

A Python class that creates a simple TCP server. In this script, it listens on `localhost:8080` and uses `OAuthHandler` to handle incoming requests. The server runs inside a context manager to ensure it shuts down cleanly after handling one request.





122
Python + Oauth2.0
handler.wfile.write()

Writes a response back to the browser window. In this script, it sends a simple message like “You may close this window” after the code is received.

CCH Tax Forms Project
Restricting XML exports to identifiers and empty fields ensures downstream processing focuses on form presence without handling taxpayer data.





131
CCH Tax Forms Project
Calling elem.clear() in Python’s ElementTree frees memory used by already-processed elements, keeping memory usage flat even on very large XML files.





132
CCH Tax Forms Project
The elem.get("AttributeName") method in Python’s ElementTree retrieves the value of an XML attribute, such as Hierarchy in <Identifier Hierarchy="…"/>.





133
CCH Tax Forms Project
Generators in Python, created with the yield keyword, let you process XML identifiers lazily one at a time instead of holding them all in memory.

Context managers in Python (with … as …) automatically close resources like files and zip archives, which is essential in batch file processing.





134
CCH Tax Forms Project
File-like objects in Python make it possible to treat zip members and normal files identically when parsing XML streams.





135
CCH Tax Forms Project
Namespaces in XML appear as long URIs in tags (e.g., {http://…}Identifier), and in ElementTree you can split on } to isolate the local tag name.





136
CCH Tax Forms Project
Streaming parsers like ElementTree.iterparse in Python are preferable for large XML exports because they process elements sequentially without loading the entire document.





137
Active Directory and Azure Files
Azure AD DS (Managed Domain)
A hosted domain service in Azure that provides AD DS without full domain controllers. Some orgs use this for Azure Files instead of extending their on-prem AD.





138
Active Directory and Azure Files
userAccountControl Attribute
A bitmask controlling properties of an AD account (enabled, disabled, password never expires, etc.). Not where the Kerberos key lives.





139
Active Directory and Azure Files
Port 445 (SMB over TCP)
Required for SMB traffic. Many ISPs block this outbound, so Azure Files is usually used over VPN or ExpressRoute with a private endpoint.





140
Active Directory and Azure Files
Azure DNS Private Zone
Used to override DNS resolution of <storageaccount>.file.core.windows.net so it resolves to your private endpoint. Critical for Kerberos because the SPN must match.





141
Active Directory and Azure Files
Access Control Entry (ACE)
An individual line in an ACL (e.g., “Group=Accounting, Permission=Read”).





142
Active Directory and Azure Files
Key Distribution Center (KDC)
A service running on domain controllers that issues Kerberos tickets (TGTs and service tickets).





143
Active Directory and Azure Files
Time Skew
Kerberos is sensitive to clock drift. If a client and DC differ by more than ~5 minutes, tickets are rejected. Important when mixing on-prem and cloud.





144
Active Directory and Azure Files
Domain
A logical security boundary and namespace (e.g., corp.contoso.com) that contains users, computers, and policies.





145

A network interface in your VNet that maps a private IP to a PaaS resource. For Azure Files, it’s how on-prem clients connect securely without relying on public 445.





146
Active Directory and Azure Files
Azure Entra ID Kerberos (AAD Kerberos)
A newer model where Entra ID itself issues Kerberos tickets. Removes dependency on on-prem AD DS but behaves slightly differently.





147
Active Directory and Azure Files
Service Principal Name (SPN)
An attribute on an AD object that maps a service instance to that account. For Azure Files, the SPN is:
cifs/<storageaccount>.file.core.windows.net





148
Active Directory and Azure Files
Duplicate SPN
A misconfiguration where two AD objects both claim the same SPN. Kerberos can’t decide which to use, so authentication fails.





149
Active Directory and Azure Files
Discretionary ACL (DACL)
Defines who is allowed or denied access. The type you’ll be working with when setting NTFS permissions on Azure Files.





150
Azure Files Documentation
Azure file shares use the Kerberos protocol to authenticate with an identity source. When an identity associated with a user or application running on a client attempts to access data in Azure file shares, the request is sent to the identity source to authenticate the identity.





151
Azure Files Documentation
# Create the Kerberos key on the storage account and get the Kerb1 key as the password for the AD identity 
# to represent the storage account

154
Azure Files Documentation
To assign share-level RBAC permissions to specific users or groups, on-premises AD DS identities must be synced to Microsoft Entra ID using Entra Connect Sync. If identities aren't synced, you must use a default share-level permission, which applies to all authenticated users





155
Azure Files Documentation
In order to enable AES-256 encryption, the domain object that represents your storage account must be a computer account (default) or service logon account in the on-premises AD domain. If your domain object doesn't meet this requirement, delete it and create a new domain object that does.





156
Azure Files Documentation
You can enable identity-based authentication over SMB using one of three identity sources: On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Microsoft Entra Domain Services, or Microsoft Entra Kerberos (hybrid identities only). You can only use one identity source for file access authentication per storage account.





157
Azure Files Documentation
A storage account key is an administrator key for a storage account, including administrator permissions to all files and folders within the file share you're accessing, and for all file shares and other storage resources (blobs, queues, tables, etc.) contained within your storage account.





158
Azure Files Documentation
SMB Multichannel enables clients to use multiple network connections that provide increased performance while lowering the cost of ownership. Increased performance is achieved through bandwidth aggregation over multiple NICs and utilizing Receive Side Scaling (RSS) support for NICs to distribute the I/O load across multiple CPUs.

161
Azure Files Documentation
SMB file shares communicate over port 445, which many organizations and internet service providers (ISPs) block for outbound (internet) traffic. This practice originates from legacy security guidance about deprecated and non-internet safe versions of the SMB protocol. SMB 3.x does not share these vulnerabilities.





162
Azure Files Documentation
When using AD DS authentication, you assign share-level permissions to hybrid identities synced to Microsoft Entra ID while managing file/directory-level access using Windows ACLs.





163
Azure Files Documentation
You can access your Azure file shares over the public internet accessible endpoint, over one or more private endpoints on your network(s), or by caching your Azure file share on-premises with Azure File Sync (SMB file shares only).





164
Azure Files Documentation
Many important settings, such as network and security rules, are applied at the storage account level. You should consider the storage account to be a trust boundary and only place classic file shares in the same storage account if you're ok with them having the same security settings.

Python
Q:
How can decorators be used to modify the behavior of generator functions?

A:
By defining a decorator that wraps the generator function, potentially altering how yield statements are handled or adding additional functionality before and after iteration.





171
Python
How can you compare two Path objects for equality regardless of their string representations? By resolving both paths and comparing them.

path1 = Path('/home/user/file.txt').resolve()
path2 = Path('./file.txt').resolve()
are_equal = path1 == path2





172
Python
Q:
What does an exit code of 0 typically signify in a Python script?

A:
Successful execution without errors.





173
Python
Q:
Which itertools function can be used to create an iterator that returns elements from the first iterable until it is exhausted, then proceeds to the next iterable?

A:
itertools.chain().





174
Python
Q:
What is the difference between itertools.accumulate() and itertools.reduce()?

A:
itertools.accumulate() returns an iterator that yields accumulated sums (or results of a specified function), while functools.reduce() applies a function cumulatively to the items of a sequence, reducing it to a single value.





175
Python
Q:
What is lazy evaluation, and how do generators implement it in Python?

A:
Lazy evaluation is a strategy where computations are deferred until their results are needed. Generators implement lazy evaluation by yielding one item at a time, generating each value only when requested.





176
Python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Pre-processing
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Post-processing
        return result
    return wrapper

def change_dir(destination):
    original_dir = os.getcwd()
    os.chdir(destination)
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        os.chdir(original_dir)

# Usage
with change_dir('/new/path'):
    # Code operates in '/new/path'
    pass
# Returns to original directory





178
Python
Q:
What is the difference between yield and return in a generator function?

A:
yield produces a value and pauses the generator, allowing it to resume later, while return exits the function and optionally returns a value, terminating the generator.





179
Python
Q:
How can you raise an exception inside a generator from outside?

A:
Using the .throw(type, value=None, traceback=None) method.





180
Python
Q:
How can you create mutually exclusive command-line arguments using argparse?

A:
By using the add_mutually_exclusive_group() method.

Example:
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group()
group.add_argument('--add', action='store_true')
group.add_argument('--remove', action='store_true')
args = parser.parse_args()





181
Python
Q:
What is the purpose of sys.getrecursionlimit() and sys.setrecursionlimit(limit)?

A:
To retrieve and set the maximum depth of the Python interpreter stack, respectively, which controls how many times a recursive function can call itself.





182
Python
Q:
How can generators be used to implement a producer-consumer pattern?

A:
Generators can act as producers by yielding data, which consumers can iterate over, allowing for efficient and decoupled data processing.

Example:
def producer():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i

def consumer(gen):
    for item in gen:
        print(f"Consumed: {item}")

gen = producer()
consumer(gen)





183
Python
Q:
What are the two essential methods that an iterator class must implement?

A:
__iter__() and __next__().





184
Python
Q:
Why should you prefer sys.exit() over exit() in production scripts?

A:
sys.exit() is more explicit and is the standard way to exit scripts, while exit() is intended for interactive shells and may not behave as expected in all environments.





185
Python
How can you safely delete a file using pathlib while handling potential exceptions by using a try-except block around the .unlink() method.

Example:
from pathlib import Path

file = Path('file_to_delete.txt')
try:
    file.unlink()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File does not exist.")
except PermissionError:
    print("Permission denied.")





186
Python
Read a file in chunks by defining a generator that reads and yields fixed-size chunks from the file.

Example:
def read_in_chunks(file_path, chunk_size=1024):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(chunk_size)
            if not chunk:
                break
            yield chunk

for chunk in read_in_chunks('large_file.bin'):
    process(chunk)  # Hypothetical function





187
Python
How can you add an optional argument with a default value using argparse?

A:
By specifying the argument name with -- and providing the default parameter.

Example:
parser.add_argument('--verbose', action='store_true', default=False, help='Enable verbose output')





188
Python
Classic OOP __init__
Manually defines the constructor. More verbose, but clearer for teams unfamiliar with dataclasses. Full control over initialization.





189
Python
Custom Logging Configuration
Use logging.config.dictConfig for structured logging setup.
Supports multiple handlers (console + file) and formatters in a single config dictionary.





190
Python
Front: What should you do after getting the imports working with hacks, for cleaner long-term code?
Back: Rename folders to valid package names, add __init__.py files, and switch to proper package or absolute imports.





191
Python
Front: What is the only requirement for an __init__.py file to turn a folder into a Python package?
Back: It can be completely empty—its mere presence signals Python that the folder is a package.





192
Python
Empty DataFrame Handling
Calling pd.concat([]) raises an error.
Guard with if dfs: before concatenating, or return an empty DataFrame with expected columns.





193
Python
Front: Will adding an empty __init__.py in your Azure Functions project root break the Azure Functions loader?
Back: No—as long as each function remains in its own folder with its own function.json and entry script, the root __init__.py won’t be treated as a function.





194
Python
Front: What’s the quick “sys.path hack” to import a module from a sibling or parent folder?
Back:

python
>>>
import sys, os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), os.pardir)))
import your_module

Power BI
Q: How can you verify gateway-related issues are not causing silent failures?
A: Download gateway logs (Admin Portal → Gateways → Diagnostics) and search for timeouts or errors (e.g., QueryTimeoutException). Also check gateway CPU/memory spikes.





296
Power BI
Q: If you freeze only half your rows (e.g., 100 K of 200 K), what kind of refresh time improvement can you expect?
A: Roughly a proportional gain—halving the pulled rows typically cuts variable query time nearly in half; speed-up may be ~40 % overall because fixed overhead (connection setup) remains.





297
Power BI
Q: What are common pitfalls when manually partitioning with two queries?
A: Forgetting to disable History after its catch-up refresh (causes full pull), mismatched schemas between History & Recent, and letting the Historical table outgrow available memory.





298
Power BI
What pattern lets you reference intermediate calculations by name when building a calculated table?
Use a two-step ADDCOLUMNS approach: first add your intermediate columns, then in a second ADDCOLUMNS call reference those names to compute further results (for example, percentages).





299
Power BI
Q: What are the two main components of query execution time when pulling data via SQL?
A: Fixed costs (connection setup, query plan, authentication, network latency) and variable costs (reading/transmitting each row). Reducing row count cuts the variable portion.





300
Power BI
Q: What indicates a break in query folding when reviewing Query Diagnostics in Power Query?
A: In the “Folding” diagnostic table, any step marked “Not foldable” shows where folding stopped, meaning subsequent transformations happen client‐side.





301
Power BI
Q: What is VertiPaq and why is it relevant when appending tables?
A: VertiPaq is Power BI’s in‐memory columnar engine. When appending tables with identical schemas, VertiPaq compresses and merges columns efficiently, making the in‐memory append step very fast.





302
Power BI
Q: What is the default command timeout for the SQL Server connector in Power Query?
A: 10 minutes. Queries taking longer will time out unless you explicitly increase the CommandTimeout in the M step.





303
Power BI
Q: What are the risks of using a static RangeStart parameter over a long period?
A: If you never update RangeStart, new “late-arriving” or back‐dated changes older than that date won’t be captured. You risk permanently missing updates unless you periodically advance the boundary.





304
Power BI
Q: What is “query folding” and why does it matter for refresh timeouts?
A: Query folding means pushing filtering/sorting logic down to the data source. If a step breaks folding, Power Query pulls all rows client-side, increasing data volume and risking timeouts.





305
Power BI
Q: Name one alternative to the SQL connector when connecting to Dataverse that can improve folding and avoid timeouts.
A: Use the built-in Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector via Get Data → Dataverse. It often auto-folds better into Dataverse’s paging model than the SQL (TDS) endpoint.

Returns the first non-null value from a list of expressions (e.g., COALESCE(ts_invoiceid, inv.ts_invoiceid)).





317
TSQL
Q: What happens in T-SQL if you use GROUP BY but select columns that are not aggregated or not in the GROUP BY clause?
A: You get an error. All columns in the SELECT must either be part of the GROUP BY clause or be wrapped in an aggregate function like SUM, AVG, MAX, etc.

Terraform Codebox
The cloud-init mechanism in Azure allows Terraform to provision the VM on first boot, such as installing software, mounting storage, or configuring files.

Example inside VM block:

hcl
custom_data = base64encode(templatefile("${path.module}/cloud-init.yaml.tpl", {...}))





319
Terraform Codebox
Terraform allows you to target specific parts of your infrastructure using -target. This makes it possible to destroy or apply only a specific module like a VM while keeping persistent resources like storage intact.


bash
terraform destroy -target=module.ephemeral





320
Terraform Codebox
Output values expose key info (like public IPs) after apply. They can be used to chain modules or help humans connect to deployed infrastructure.


hcl
output "ip" {
  value = azurerm_public_ip.this.ip_address
}





321
Terraform Codebox
Data sources in Terraform let you read existing cloud resources without managing them. You use them when you want to reference things created outside of Terraform.


hcl
data "azurerm_client_config" "current" {}





322
Terraform Codebox
Shebang (#!/bin/bash)
The first line in many shell scripts, it tells the system which interpreter to use (e.g., bash). Required in cloud-init scripts if you’re writing inline scripts to ensure consistent behavior.

326
Terraform Codebox
The az login command authenticates your local environment with Azure CLI. Terraform can use these credentials by enabling use_cli = true in your provider block.





327
Terraform Codebox
Terraform modules allow you to organize and reuse code. You can define a VM, network, or storage module once and use it in multiple places with different variables passed in.

Example root call:

hcl
module "ephemeral" {
  source = "./modules/ephemeral"
  vm_name = "devbox"
}





328
Terraform Codebox
Lifecycle blocks let you fine-tune resource behavior — for example, prevent Terraform from destroying something with prevent_destroy = true.


hcl
lifecycle {
  prevent_destroy = true
}





329
Terraform Codebox
.gitignore is used to tell Git which files or folders not to track. In Terraform projects, this prevents large or sensitive files like .terraform/ and .tfstate from being added accidentally.


markdown
.terraform/
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*





330
Terraform Codebox
curl -L -o filename
A command to download files over HTTP. The -L flag tells curl to follow redirects, and -o filename specifies a custom filename for the output, useful for scripting repeatable installs.

In Microsoft Purview, you implement data loss prevention by defining and applying DLP policies. A DLP policy can help you identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive data-at-rest, data-in-motion, and data-in-use. DLP policies act on a variety of locations, methods of data transmission, and types of user activities.

Data access is about quickly providing the right access and enforcing the right use to balance safety and innovation.

Data curation is about organizing, annotating, and publishing your data so that it's safely accessible, reuseable, and protected.





338
Microsoft Purview
You can configure your policies so that, when a DLP policy is triggered, email notifications are sent automatically, and policy tips are shown to admins and end users. Policy tips are useful ways to raise awareness of risky behaviors on sensitive items and train users to avoid those behaviors in the future.





339
Microsoft Purview
DLP policies are how you monitor the activities that users take on sensitive items at rest, sensitive items in transit, or sensitive items in use and then take protective actions. For example, when a user attempts a prohibited action, like copying a sensitive item to an unapproved location or sharing medical information in an email, DLP can:

show a pop-up policy tip to the user that warns them that they might be trying to share a sensitive item inappropriately

Members of your compliance team who will create and sensitivity labels need permissions to the Microsoft Purview portal. You can use the following role groups:

    Information Protection
    Information Protection Admins
    Information Protection Analysts
    Information Protection Investigators
    Information Protection Readers

The Microsoft Purview Data Map provides the foundation for data discovery and data governance. It captures metadata about data present in analytics, software-as-a-service (SaaS), and operational systems in hybrid, on-premises, and multicloud environments. The data map stays up to date with its built-in scanning and classification system.

pfSense
Netgate offers an automatic configuration backup service, known as Auto Config Backup or ACB, which is free for anyone to use.

When pfSense software makes a backup via ACB, either automatically or manually, it encrypts the config.xml configuration file using AES-256 and a key provided by the administrator with options suitable for file encryption.





353
pfSense
There is a wealth of additional information and user experiences available on the various Netgate websites. The best way to search the sites is a Google search appending site:netgate.com to the query. This will search the website, forum, documentation, etc. which are all official sources of information.





354
pfSense
pfSense software also transmits a unique and random “device key” to privately identify which backups belong to a given installation.

This device key must be unique to each firewall backing up its configuration. To do this the key is automatically generated by taking the SHA256 hash of the SSH service keys on the installation. This allows ACB to reliably and properly identify ownership of each backup in an anonymous way.

Azure Backup for Azure file shares handles the scheduling and retention of snapshots. Its grandfather-father-son (GFS) capabilities mean that you can take daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly snapshots, each with their own distinct retention period.





415
Azure Files Documentation
You can back up your Azure file share via share snapshots, which are read-only, point-in-time copies of your share. Snapshots are incremental, meaning they only contain as much data as has changed since the previous snapshot. You can have up to 200 snapshots per file share and retain them for up to 10 years.

428
Python
The purpose of the @contextmanager decorator in the contextlib module is to simplify the creation of context managers by allowing you to write a generator function that yields control back to the context.

Example:
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def my_context():
    # Setup code
    yield
    # Teardown code





429
Python
Q:
How can you create an asynchronous generator in Python?

A:
By defining a generator function with async def and using yield or yield from within it.

Example:
async def async_gen():
    for i in range(3):
        yield i





430
Python
Q:
How can you memoize a generator function to cache its results?

A:
By using decorators like functools.lru_cache() on generator functions, although it's generally more suited for regular functions. For generators, you might need to implement custom caching.

Note:
functools.lru_cache() does not work directly with generator functions since they return iterators. Instead, consider converting the generator to a list and then caching.





431
Python
Q:
What does the action='store_true' parameter do in argparse?

A:
It stores True if the argument is present, and False otherwise, typically used for boolean flags.

Example:
parser.add_argument('--verbose', action='store_true', help='Enable verbose output')

JavaScript Concepts
setTimeout / setImmediate / process.nextTick
Node/browser scheduling APIs:

    setTimeout(fn, 0): next macrotask

    setImmediate(fn): “check” phase in Node (after I/O)

JavaScript Concepts
Object.assign(): This method can be used to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
Object.assign(obj, { key3: "value3" }); // Adds key3 with value3





525
JavaScript Concepts
By default, all parameters defined in the function declaration are optional in JavaScript. If you provide fewer arguments than there are parameters, the missing arguments will be undefined inside the function, see Null and Undefined.





526
JavaScript Concepts
Macrotask (Task) Queue
Also called the “callback queue.” Holds callbacks from things like setTimeout, I/O events, and UI rendering.





527
JavaScript Concepts
For objects, by default String returns an unhelpful text.

String({ key: 'value' });
// => '[object Object]'





528
JavaScript Concepts
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has been completed. This allows for more flexible and modular code, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations.





529
JavaScript Concepts
The basic syntax for a string template in JavaScript uses backticks (`) and ${} for embedding expressions.
  const name = 'Jay';
  const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Jay!





530
JavaScript Concepts
To create a deep copy of an object in JavaScript, you can use the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object)) method. This approach works well for simple objects, such as those with string:number pairs, and ensures that the original object remains unmodified.





531
JavaScript Concepts
Type Coercion to boolean commonly occurs for
    the condition of an if statement
    the first operand of the ternary operator ?
    the operand of the logical NOT operator !
    the operands of the logical AND && and OR || operators (the result of the expression is one of the operands, not necessarily a boolean)





532
JavaScript Concepts
Front: Can you nest string templates within each other?
Back: Yes, you can nest string templates within each other.

JavaScript Concepts
Uncaught Promise Rejection
A Promise that rejects without any .catch() or try/catch(await). Can crash Node or trigger browser warnings.





534
JavaScript Concepts
Object literal { length: n } is just “array-like”: any object with a numeric .length can drive Array.from.
  let cols = Array.from({ length: n }, () => [])





535
JavaScript Concepts
Key-Value Pairs: Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs. Each key is a string (or symbol) and each value can be any data type, including other objects2.





536
JavaScript Concepts
await
Pauses execution of its enclosing async function until the given Promise settles, then returns its value (or throws its rejection).

Power BI
Q: How can using the “Enable Load of Related Entities” option in the Dataverse connector improve performance?
    A:

    This option, in the Dataverse (OData) connector, fetches related lookup or option‐set tables alongside the main entity in one API call.

    Reduces the number of round trips, preserves folding, and can significantly cut down on refresh time compared to separately querying each related table.





538
Power BI
Q: Why might using a Date dimension table improve model performance and simplify filters?
    A:

    A dedicated Date table lets you create one‐to‐many relationships to fact tables and use date‐intelligence DAX functions efficiently.

    It centralizes filters (e.g., Year, Quarter) rather than filtering on a date column in every fact, reducing the complexity of DAX queries that run during refresh or visual rendering.





539
Power BI
How does ALLEXCEPT work in a measure?
ALLEXCEPT(table, column1, …) removes all filters on the specified table except those on the listed columns. It’s used inside CALCULATE to preserve only certain filters (for example, keep EngagementID but ignore Task Category).





540
Power BI
Q: How can Aggregations in Power BI speed up queries on large fact tables?
    A:

    Define a summarized (aggregated) table at a higher grain (e.g., daily sales totals) and point visuals to it for common queries.

    The engine stores both the detailed and aggregated tables; for queries that can be satisfied by the aggregate, Power BI never scans the full fact table, reducing query time dramatically.





541
Power BI
Q: How do you use Performance Analyzer in Power BI Desktop?
A: In Report view, go to View → Performance Analyzer → Start Recording → Refresh Visuals. It shows DAX query times, visual rendering times, etc., for each visual.





542
Power BI
Why might SUMMARIZECOLUMNS yield better performance than SUMMARIZE?
The Tabular engine has built-in optimizations for SUMMARIZECOLUMNS that reduce temporary table materializations and merge identical aggregations, resulting in faster query plans, especially on large fact tables.





543
Power BI
Q: Why might a table visual in Power BI show fewer rows than exist in the dataset even if the data model has all rows?
A: Large table visuals can hit rendering timeouts or be partially truncated. Use Performance Analyzer to see if the DAX query or visual rendering is timing out.





544
Power BI
What’s the scope of variables (VAR) inside an ADDCOLUMNS column definition?
A VAR declared inside one column’s definition lives only within that column. To share results, you must either repeat the logic or separate the columns into multiple ADDCOLUMNS calls so that the column values exist in the table.





545
Power BI
Q: What is the typical Power BI Service behavior when you define an Incremental Refresh policy but deploy to a Pro workspace?
A: The service ignores the policy and performs a full‐table refresh each time, without partitioning.





546
Power BI
Q: How do incremental refresh policies handle late-arriving data, and what can you do to mitigate missed updates?
    A:

    Incremental refresh typically uses a RangeStart/RangeEnd window; any rows older than RangeStart aren’t re-queried.

    To capture late-arriving updates, include a “stale data window” (e.g., overlapping dates) so you reprocess recent partitions that might receive back‐dated changes, then drop duplicates in Power Query or DAX.

TSQL
Indexing Considerations:

Ensure columns used in JOINs or WHERE clauses are indexed for better performance.





553
TSQL
User-Defined Functions (UDFs):

Custom functions that return scalar values or tables, encapsulating reusable logic.





554
TSQL
Transactions and Isolation Levels:

Use BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK to group related SQL statements, ensuring data integrity.
Isolation levels (e.g., READ COMMITTED) manage concurrency and data consistency.





555
TSQL

Azure Files supports identity-based authentication for Windows file shares over Server Message Block (SMB) using the Kerberos authentication protocol through the following methods:

    On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
    Microsoft Entra Domain Services
    Microsoft Entra Kerberos for hybrid user identities





638
Azure Files Documentation
The access tier of the file share dictates to the ratio of storage to IOPS/throughput costs (in the form of transactions). There are three access tiers: transaction optimized, hot, and cool. Changing the tier of the Azure file share results in transaction costs for the movement to the new access tier.





639
Azure Files Documentation
On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

AD DS is commonly adopted by enterprises in on-premises environments or on cloud-hosted VMs, and AD DS credentials are used for access control. For more information, see Active Directory Domain Services Overview.





640
Azure Files Documentation
If a machine isn't domain joined, you can still use AD DS for authentication if the machine has unimpeded network connectivity to the on-premises AD domain controller and the user provides explicit credentials. For more information, see Mount the file share from a non-domain-joined VM or a VM joined to a different AD domain.





641
Azure Files Documentation
Hybrid identities

Azure Files Documentation
File shares (preview), offered by the Microsoft.FileShares resource provider. File shares are a new top-level resource that simplify the deployment of Azure Files by eliminating the storage account. Unlike classic file shares, which must be deployed into a storage account, file shares are deployed directly into the resource group like storage accounts themselves





651
Azure Files Documentation
Beginning with Windows Server 2025, Kerberos no longer honors the legacy registry key REG_DWORD SupportedEncryptionTypes found in the path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Parameters. Microsoft recommends using group policy instead.





652
Azure Files Documentation
Using the storage account key to mount the Azure file share is effectively an administrator operation, because the mounted file share has full permissions to all of the files and folders on the share, even if they have ACLs. When using the storage account key to mount over SMB, the NTLMv2 authentication protocol is used.





653
Azure Files Documentation
Soft delete is a storage-account level setting that allows you to recover your file share when it's accidentally deleted. When a file share is deleted, it transitions to a soft deleted state instead of being permanently erased. You can configure the amount of time soft deleted shares are recoverable before they're permanently deleted.

Q:
How does using yield from affect the performance of a generator?

A:
yield from can improve performance by delegating part of the generator’s operations to another generator, reducing overhead and simplifying code.

Example:
def generator1():
    yield from range(1000)

def generator2():
    yield from generator1()

# More efficient delegation





659
Python
Q:
How can you profile a generator to identify performance bottlenecks?

verbose = False  # Set based on some condition

for i in tqdm(range(100), desc='Processing', disable=not verbose):
    pass





670
Python
Q:
How can you ensure that all resources are properly released when using multiple context managers?

A:
By using nested with statements or contextlib.ExitStack to manage multiple context managers efficiently.

Example with ExitStack:
from contextlib import ExitStack

with ExitStack() as stack:
    file1 = stack.enter_context(open('file1.txt'))
    file2 = stack.enter_context(open('file2.txt'))
    # Work with files





671
Python
Q:
How can you add a dynamic description to a tqdm progress bar?

Python
Front: How can you avoid Python syntax errors when your folder has spaces in its name (e.g. Retain Integration)?
Back: Either rename the folder to a valid identifier (e.g. retain_integration), or load it manually using importlib.util.spec_from_file_location.





675
Python
Front: How do you perform a relative import from a child module to a parent module in a package?
Back: Use syntax like from ..parent_pkg import parent_module (with __init__.py files marking each package level).





676
Python
Zip Slip (Path Traversal Attack)
Malicious zips can contain members like ../../etc/passwd.
Naïve extractall() writes outside the intended folder.
Fix: use Path.resolve() to normalize paths and ensure they remain within a safe directory.





677
Python
Forward References in Type Hints
Type hints can refer to classes not yet defined.
Solutions: quotes ("Node") or from __future__ import annotations.





678
Python
Assertions vs. Explicit Checks
assert can be stripped away with python -O.
For production code, prefer if ...: raise ValueError or RuntimeError.





679
Python
Front: Why does ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package occur?
Back: Because you ran the script directly (not as a module under its package), so Python doesn’t recognize its “parent.”
