Perhaps the most effective technique to reduce a model size is to use a summary table from the data source. Where a detail table might contain every transaction, a summary table would contain one record per day, per week, or per month. It might be an average of all of the transactions per day, for instance.

Other metadata that you should consider is the information about the semantic model as a whole, such as the file size and data refresh rates. You can find this metadata in the associated Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file. The data that you load into Power BI Desktop is compressed and stored to the disk by the VertiPaq storage engine.

2. You're developing a semantic model in Power BI Desktop. You've just added a date table by using the CALENDARAUTO function. You've extended it with calculated columns, and you've related it to other model tables. What else should you do to ensure that DAX time intelligence calculations work correctly? 

You must mark the date table so that Power BI can correctly filter its dates.





20
MS Data Analyst
If your formula needs to reference columns in other tbales and the tables aren't related, you can use the LOOKUPVALUE DAX function. Generally, try to use the RELATED function whenever possible. It will usually perform better than the LOOKUPVALUE function due to the ways that relationship and column data is stored and indexed.

Variables do not require the use of EARLIER or EARLIEST DAX functions, which are difficult to understand. These functions were required before variables were introduced, and were written in complex expressions that introduced new filter contexts. Now that you can use variables instead of those functions, you can write fewer complex formulas.

Time intelligence calculations modify date filter contexts. They can help you answer these time-related questions:

• What's the accumulation of revenue for the year, quarter, or month?
• What revenue was produced for the same period last year?
What growth in revenue has been achieved over the same period last year?

Visual cache - When you load a visual, you can't clear this visual cache without closing Power BI Desktop and opening it again. To avoid any caching in play, you need to start your analysis with a clean visual cache.

To ensure that you have a clear visual cache, add a blank page to your Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file and then, with that page selected, save and close the file. Reopen the Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file that you want to analyze. It will open on the blank page.

Many DAX time intelligence functions are concerned with standard date periods, specifically years, quarters, and months. If you have irregular time periods (for example, financial months that begin mid-way through the calendar month), or you need to work with weeks or time periods (hours, minutes, and so on), the DAX time intelligence functions won't be helpful. Instead, you'll need to use the CALCULATE function and pass in hand-crafted date or time filters.

Type of Performance Analyzer task:
Other - The time it took the visual to prepare queries, wait for other visuals to complete, or perform other background processing tasks. If this category displays a long duration, the only real way to reduce this duration is to optimize DAX queries for other visuals, or reduce the number of visuals in the report.





43
MS Data Analyst
Data engine cache - When a query is run, the results are cached, so the results of your analysis will be misleading. You need to clear the data cache before rerunning the visual.

To clear the data cache, you can either restart Power BI Desktop or connect DAX Studio to the semantic model and then call Clear Cache.

3. You have a table that stores account balance snapshots for each date, excluding weekends. You need to ensure that your measure formula only filters by a single date. Also, if no record is on the last date of a time period, it should use the latest account balance. Which DAX time intelligence function should you use? 

The LASTNONBLANK function will return the last date in the filter context where a snapshot record exists. This option will help you achieve the objective.

3. You're developing a Power BI desktop model that sources data from an Excel workbook. The workbook has an employee table that stores one row for each employee. Each row has a reference to the employee's manager, which is also a row in the employee table. You need to add several columns to the Employee table in your model to analyze payroll data within the organization hierarchy (like, executive level, manager level, and so on). Which technique will you use to add the columns? 

You can use the DAX parent-child functions to naturalize the recursive (employee-manager) relationship into columns.





60
MS Data Analyst
If your formula needs to reference columns in other tables, and if the tables are related, directly or indirectly, you can use the RELATED or RELATEDTABLE DAX function. The RELATED function retrieves the value at the one-side of the relationship, while the RELATEDTABLE retrieves values on the many-side. The RELATEDTABLE function returns a table object.





61
MS Data Analyst
LASTNONBLANK(<column>, <expression>)

<column>: A column expression.
<expression>: An expression evaluated for blanks for each value of column2.
The function returns a table containing a single column and single row with the computed last value123. This function is particularly useful when you need to analyze and present data where the last non-blank value holds significant importance, such as tracking the latest sales figures or monitoring inventory levels5.





62

3. Which of the following statements about relationships in Power BI Desktop is true? 
Relationships can be created between tables that contain different types of data.
A working relationship can be created as long as there is at least one common column between them.





63
MS Data Analyst
2. What can be achieved by removing unnecessary rows and columns? 
Deleting unnecessary rows and columns will reduce a semantic model size and it's good practice to load only necessary data into your semantic model.

Dynamic rules use specific DAX functions that return environmental values (as opposed to constants). Environmental values are returned from three specific DAX functions:

USERNAME or USERPRINCIPALNAME – Returns the Power BI authenticated user as a text value.

CUSTOMDATA - Returns the CustomData property passed in the connection string. Non-Power BI reporting tools that connect to the dataset by using a connection string can set this property, like Microsoft Excel.

Role mappings must be set up in advance of users accessing Power BI content. Role mapping involves assigning Microsoft Entra security objects to roles. Security objects can be user accounts or security groups.






4
MS Data Analyst
When possible, it’s a good practice to map roles to security groups. That way, there will be fewer mappings, and you can delegate the group membership management to the network administrators.






5
MS Data Analyst
you can consider restricting user access to Power BI model objects. Object-level security (OLS) can restrict access to specific tables and columns, and their metadata. Typically, you apply OLS to secure objects that store sensitive data, like employee personal data.






6
MS Data Analyst
When Power BI enforces OLS, not only does it restrict access to tables and columns, but it can also secure metadata. When you secure metadata, it’s not possible to retrieve information about secured tables and columns by using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs).






7
MS Data Analyst
OLS is a feature inherited from Azure Analysis Services (AAS) and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). The feature is available in Power BI Premium to provide backward compatibility for models migrated to Power BI. For this reason, it’s not possible to completely set up OLS in Power BI Desktop.






8
MS Data Analyst
You can’t mix RLS and OLS in the same role. If you need to apply RLS and OLS in the same model, create separate roles dedicated to each type. Also, you can’t set table-level security if it breaks a relationship chain. For example, if there are relationships between tables A and B, and B and C, you can't secure table B.




9
MS Data Analyst
Use the USERPRINCIPALNAME function instead of USERNAME function. It provides consistency when validating the roles in Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service.




10
MS Data Analyst
It’s efficient to apply rules to dimension tables. Power BI filters the dimension tables (that usually have a small number of rows) and uses model relationships to propagate those filters to fact tables (that contain millions of rows).

Rupali is a data modeler at Adventure Works who is developing an import model to analyze employee timesheet data. The employee table stores the employee social security number (SSN) in a column. While the model will be available for all company managers, it will also be available to employees in the Payroll department. However, reports must only reveal employee SSNs to payroll employees. What feature should Rupali use to restrict access to the SSN column? 

You can use OLS (object-level security) to secure the SSN column in the employee table.

An executive is a person who is charged with making plans and decisions that often involve a medium or long-term focus. Executives are responsible for making the business run smoothly. For example, the C-level executives at the Contoso Skateboard Store would be an executive audience.






16
MS Data Analyst
An analyst is a person who provides guidance to the organization. Analysts can be responsible for a range of tasks, often with goals of determining the effectiveness of business strategies, developing or improving processes, or implementing change. A business analyst (or data analyst) in the sales division of the Contoso Skateboard Store is an example of an analyst audience.






17
MS Data Analyst
An information worker is someone who uses data to help make decisions or take actions. Often, these decisions and actions are operational in that they are done on a daily basis. The inventory manager at the Contoso Skateboard Store, who needs up-to-date information about stock levels, is an example of an information worker audience.

MS Data Analyst
The primary goal of an analytical report is to help report consumers discover answers to a broad array of questions by interacting with the report and its visuals. Analytical reports often have many slicers to filter report data, and they often contain complex visuals that expose in-depth detail of the data.

Educational reports assume that the report consumer is unfamiliar with the data or context. So the reports must provide clear narrative detail and guidance to help with understanding. This type of report is often used in journalism and by governments to disseminate information to large audiences that have varying levels of understanding of the subject.






2
MS Data Analyst
Knowing how your report consumers are likely interacting with reports should influence your report designs. Consider the number of visuals that display together on the page, the complexity of visuals, spacing between visuals, and the use of interactive design elements such as tooltips, slicers, buttons, or filters.






3
MS Data Analyst
The report theme should express your organizational branding or aim to complement it. At a minimum, the theme should include the following elements:

A brand mark or logo symbol.

A palette of colors that align to, or complement, organizational branding. The colors should also be sufficiently different so that, when applied to visuals, they provide appropriate contrast when appearing side by side.

Text settings, including font selection, sizes, and color.

You can design Microsoft Power BI reports in Power BI Desktop or Power BI service (web portal). Power BI mobile apps don't support report design; they support only the report consumer experience.






8
MS Data Analyst
Structurally, a Power BI report connects to a single semantic model (semantic model), and it has at least one report page. However, it's common that reports have multiple pages. On each page, report objects are laid out. Report objects include:

Visuals - Visualizations of semantic model data.

Elements - Provide visual interest but don't use semantic model data. Elements include text boxes, buttons, shapes, and images.






9
MS Data Analyst
Occasionally, it might make sense to have a single report with many pages. Other times, it could make sense to separate pages into different reports. This scenario is especially true when you design those pages for a different audience or when you need to secure, share, or distribute them differently. Reports are a security and publication unit, and report pages belong to reports and can't be secured or published independently of the report.






10
MS Data Analyst
You can hide pages when they're not yet ready for use; they're a work in progress. However, you might commonly hide them because you want to control how they're accessed. You can provide report page navigation with buttons or by drilling through from a visual. It's also possible to design a page as a tooltip, which is revealed when a report consumer hovers over a visual.






11
MS Data Analyst
Good placement of report objects contributes to an ordered report design. Generally, you should place the most important information in the upper-left corner of the page and arrange the report elements from left to right and top to bottom.






12
MS Data Analyst
Rule of Thirds, Grid Layout: The rule of thirds involves dividing your frame into nine equal boxes with two vertical and two horizontal lines. This grid layout serves as a guide for arranging elements in your visualization.




13
MS Data Analyst
Rule of Thirds, Points of Interest: The four points where the lines intersect are considered the points of interest1. Placing your subjects or key data points at these intersections can create a more dynamic and engaging visualization1.




14
MS Data Analyst
Rule of Thirds, Balance and Flow: The rule of thirds helps to achieve a balanced composition that’s pleasing to the eye1. It guides the viewer’s eyes to move naturally across the visualization, enhancing the storytelling aspect of your data1.




15
MS Data Analyst
Rule of Thirds, Background and Foreground: By aligning your subjects along the grid lines, you can showcase more of the background, creating a sense of depth and context1. This can be particularly useful when you want to highlight relationships or contrasts between different data points.




16
MS Data Analyst
Rule of Thirds, Viewer Connection: The rule of thirds can help you anticipate or control how viewers’ eyes will move from one part of the screen to another1. This can enhance the viewer’s connection with your data story and make your visualization more impactful.




17
MS Data Analyst
Another important consideration when you are laying out report objects is balance. Balance is concerned with stability and structure in design. In the context of a report layout, balance refers to the weight that is distributed across the report page by the placement of objects of the same or different sizes.




18
MS Data Analyst
Balance can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. Symmetrical balance is achieved by distributing the weight evenly on both halves of the page. Asymmetrical balance is achieved through contrast.

Consider using the golden ratio as a guide to produce asymmetrical balance.




19
MS Data Analyst
In a report layout, proximity is concerned with the nearness of report objects. When a report page consists of multiple groups of related objects, you should use space to visually separate them.






20
MS Data Analyst
Contrast can be used to combine two opposing objects. The use of contrasting colors, fonts, font properties, or lines can emphasize important objects of the report design. Use this principle to direct report consumers to where they should look or which data visual they should interact with first.






1
MS Data Analyst
Margins include the border area, or edge, around each page. Having a consistently spaced border area frames the report objects.

Because there isn't a report page property to set margins, it's up to you to lay out objects in way that results in a consistent border area. Margin sizes should be equal on the left and right, with possible variation on the top and bottom. Space across the top or bottom can show branding, titles, slicers, or other information that needs to be separated from the visuals.




2
MS Data Analyst
Size and Shape: The size and shape of your visuals can also represent both continuous and discrete data1. The size of the visual should be proportional to its importance or the emphasis you want to place on it1.




3
MS Data Analyst
Line Width and Type: These are usually used to represent discrete data1. Different line widths can represent different data magnitudes, while different line types (solid, dashed, dotted) can represent different data categories1.

To change the size of the canvas in Power BI, deselect all visuals (possibly click on some empty canvas), and then go to the Visualizations > Format page pane, like changing the format or color options on a specific visual.

Additionally, you can set custom dimensions that are larger than the available screen size so that the report consumer will need to interact with scrollbars to view the entire page.

However, a large page size that is filled with visuals might take time to render, and visuals might not render in a top-to-bottom order.

While report consumers can use focus mode to enlarge a single visual, the visual should still clearly communicate its data when viewed at actual size on the report page. Focus mode can help consumers better interpret the data or more easily interact with the visual, such as expanding into levels of a matrix or decomposition tree visual.

Use the alignment commands on the Format Pane, which will help you quickly and accurately align visuals.

Use color sparingly and meaningfully because overusing it can be distracting. Stick to a few softer colors as a base, possibly aligned with corporate colors. Softer colors ensure that the data is the focus in your report. Reserve the use of bolder colors to highlight exceptions.

Consistency should apply to everything in your report design, including spacing, margins, size, alignment, and especially to object format options. Format options include the selection of font, font size, font weight, colors, and many other styling options. Format options also include the enabling of visual features like axis labels and data labels.

The quickest way to enforce consistency is to use a report theme. A report theme applies format settings to your entire report, ensuring consistent application of colors, fonts, pages, and visual format options, including the Filters pane styles.

You can use an external site like powerbi.tips to generate a theme. The site will guide you through building a color palette and setting property values for all core visual types.

Report objects are laid out on each report page and include:

Visuals - Visualizations of semantic model data.

Elements - Provide visual interest but don't use semantic model data.






13
MS Data Analyst
All report objects have some properties in common, which can be set in various sections of the Format options. Commonly applied settings include general properties (location, size, and alt text), title, background, border, and shadow.

Visuals are visualizations of semantic model data. Power BI includes over 30 core visuals, which are built in and available to all reports. You can access the core visuals in the first section of the Visualizations pane.




15
MS Data Analyst
You can extend the core visuals with custom visuals. Custom visuals are sourced from Microsoft AppSource (an app store for business applications such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Power BI, or separate Microsoft Azure web apps) or uploaded as a .pbviz file.

Line charts work well with a consistent flow of data, such as when sales are recorded for every period. If no sales are recorded for some periods, the line chart visual will fill such gaps with a straight line that connects the values of the previous and next periods. If missing values are a possibility, a column chart might be a better visual choice because it will help to avoid the interpretation of a non-existent trend.

Proportional visuals show data as part of a whole. They effectively communicate how a value is distributed across a dimension. Column and bar chart visuals work well for visualizing proportions across multiple dimensions.

Proportional visuals can't plot a mix of positive and negative values. They should be used when all values are positive or all values are negative.

Power BI core visuals that you can use to show performance include:

Gauge

KPI

Table, with conditional formatting

Matrix, with conditional formatting

In the Background section of a visual's Format Pane, you can set any color or image as the background for the visual. If you plan to use an image as a background, try to select an image that won't have lines or shapes that would make it difficult for the user to read the data.

MS Data Analyst
In the Data colors section of a visual's Format Pane, you can set the colors that you want to use for the data values in the visual. You can use different colors for different fields, but always try to be consistent when it comes to selecting those colors. It is best to use the same color scheme throughout the report.

In the Data labels section of a visual's Format Pane, you can change fonts, size, and colors for all labels in the visual. Try to use solid colors so the labels are clearly visible. For example, if the background is white, use a black or dark grey color to display your labels.

The Tooltips section of a visual's Format Pane allows you to add a customized tooltip that appears when you hover over the visual, based on report pages that you create in Power BI Desktop. Tooltips is a great feature because it provides more contextual information and detail to data points on a visual. The default tooltip displays the data point's value and category, but your custom tooltips can include visuals, images, and any other collection of items that you create in the report page.

MS Data Analyst
Another way to use tooltips is to display graphical information. The process of adding this type of tooltip is not as straightforward, but it is worthwhile. You would begin by creating a new page in the report.

Open the new page and then open the Format pane. Expand the Page Size section and then select Tooltip from the Type list.

In the Page information section, turn the Tooltip slider to On so that Power BI registers this page as a tooltip page

Tooltips have limited canvas space, so to ensure that your visuals appear in the tooltip, on the View tab, set the Page view option to Actual size.

To use a KPI, you need three pieces of information:

• A unit of measurement that you want to track, for instance total sales, number of employee hires, number of loans serviced, or number of students enrolled.
• A goal for the measurement so that you can compare your progress with the goal.
A time series, for instance daily, monthly, or yearly.
