 802.1X
802.1X is a standard for port-based network access control (PNAC), but it
does not inherently provide any single sign-on functionality.

B. Require the use of S/MIME
S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides a way
to integrate public key encryption and digital signatures into most modern
email clients. This would encrypt all email information from client to
client, regardless of the communication used between email servers.

A company hires a large number of seasonal employees, and their
system access should normally be disabled when the employee leaves
the company. The security administrator would like to verify that their
systems cannot be accessed by any of the former employees. Which of the
following would be the BEST way to provide this verification?
C. Validate the processes and procedures for all
outgoing employees
The disabling of an employee account is commonly part of the offboarding
process. One way to validate an offboarding policy is to perform an audit
of all accounts and compare active accounts with active employees.

Which of the following risk management strategies would include the
purchase and installation of an NGFW?
The Answer: B. Mitigation
Mitigation is a strategy that decreases the threat level. This is commonly
done through the use of additional security systems and monitoring, such
as an NGFW (Next-Generation Firewall)

A security engineer runs a monthly vulnerability scan. The scan doesnâ€™t
list any vulnerabilities for Windows servers, but a significant vulnerability
was announced last week and none of the servers are patched yet. Which
of the following best describes this result?
D. False negative
A false negative is a result that fails to detect an issue when one
actually exists.

A manufacturing company would like to use an existing router to
separate a corporate network and a manufacturing floor that use the same
physical switch. The company does not want to install any additional
hardware. Which of the following would be the BEST choice for this
segmentation?
. Create separate VLANs for the corporate network and
the manufacturing floor
Creating VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) will segment a network
without requiring additional switches.

A. EAP-TLS
EAP-TLS does not provide a mechanism for using multiple
authentication types within a TLS tunnel.
B. PEAP
PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) encapsulates EAP
within a TLS tunnel, but does not provide a method of encapsulating
other authentication methods.

 A member of the accounting team was out of the office for two weeks,
and an important financial transfer was delayed until they returned.
Which of the following would have prevented this delay?
 C. Job rotation
Job rotation moves employees through different job roles as part of their
normal work environment. This policy limits the potential for fraud and
allows others to cover responsibilities if someone is out of the office.

A security team has been provided with a non-credentialed vulnerability
scan report created by a third-party. Which of the following would they
expect to see on this report?
INCORRECT: A list of all unpatched operating system files
Viewing detailed information about the operating system files requires
authentication to the OS, and an uncredentialed scan does not have those
permissions.

A security administrator is concerned about data exfiltration resulting
from the use of malicious phone charging stations. Which of the
following would be the BEST way to protect against this threat?
A. USB data blocker
USB data blockers are physical USB cables that allow power connections
but prevent data connections. With a USB data blocker attached, any
power source can be used without a security concern.

A security analyst has identified a number of sessions from a single IP
address with a TTL equal to zero. One of the sessions has a destination of
the Internet firewall, and a session immediately after has a destination of
your DMZ server. Which of the following BEST describes this
log information?
he Answer: D. Someone is performing a traceroute to the DMZ server
A traceroute maps each hop by slowly incrementing the TTL (Time
to Live) value during each request. When the TTL reaches zero, the
receiving router drops the packet and sends an ICMP (Internet Control
Message Protocol) TTL Exceeded message back to the original station.

EAP-TTLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol - Tunneled Transport
Layer Security) allows the use of multiple authentication protocols
transported inside of an encrypted TLS (Transport Layer Security) tunnel.
This allows the use of any authentication while maintaining confidentiality
with TLS.

 A member of the accounting team was out of the office for two weeks,
and an important financial transfer was delayed until they returned.
Which of the following would have prevented this delay?
INCORRECT A. Split knowledge
The use of split knowledge limits the information that any one person
would know. In this example, having knowledge of part of the process
would not have helped with processing the financial transfer.

A designer-first integration service is a type of integration service that focuses on providing a user-friendly and design-centric interface for designers to connect different software tools and applications.

This type of service typically allows designers to create custom workflows and integrations between various tools without requiring any coding or technical expertise. It often provides drag-and-drop functionality and pre-built templates to simplify the integration process.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used in text editors and web applications to format and style text. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the goal of allowing people to write using an easy-to-read, plain-text format that could then be converted into HTML.

Markdown uses simple syntax, such as asterisks for bold text and hyphens for lists, to indicate formatting. The resulting text is easy to read and write, making it a popular choice for technical documentation, blogging, and note-taking.

General
In the context of IT, Markdown is often used in software development and documentation as a way to format and style text within code repositories and project documentation. It is also commonly used in collaboration tools and web-based editors, such as GitHub and Stack Overflow, for its ease of use and readability.

S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose internet Mail Extensions) is a widely accepted protocol for sending digitally signed and encrypted messages. S/MIME in Exchange Online provides the following services for email messages:

Encryption: Protects the content of email messages.
Digital signatures: Verifies the identity of the sender of an email message.





25
Security+
S/MIME is widely used in IT to secure email communication, especially in organizations that deal with sensitive or confidential information. However, it is important to note that both the sender and receiver must have S/MIME support and have exchanged digital certificates for this to work.
