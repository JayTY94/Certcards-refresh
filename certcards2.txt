The PATH() function is used to convert a parent-child relationship in a delimited text format. The syntax of the PATH() function is 

  PATH(<ID_columnName>, <parent_columnName>).

Creating a hierarchy in Power BI is straightforward. You can right-click on the field you want to set as level 1 of the hierarchy in the fields list and select "Create Hierarchy". You can then add additional levels to the hierarchy by dragging and dropping or using the “Add to hierarchy” option





13
MS Data Analyst
A hierarchy consists of multiple levels, where one level is the parent of another level. For example, a category, subcategory, and product can form a hierarchy. There is no limit on the number of levels; it can be one or more than ten levels.

Power BI imposes dataset size restrictions, which limit the size of a model. When you publish the model to a shared capacity, there’s a 1-GB limit per dataset. When this size limit is exceeded, the dataset will fail to refresh.

Choose the import model framework whenever possible. This framework offers you the most options, design flexibility, and delivers fast performance. Be sure to apply data reduction techniques to ensure that Power BI loads the least amount of data possible.

The Model view in Power BI desktop provides many options within the column properties that you can view or update. A simple method to get to this menu to update the tables and fields is by Ctrl+clicking or Shift+clicking items on this page.
Under the Formatting tab, you can:

  Change the data type.
  Format the date.

In the syntax of Power Query statements, the # character is not used as a special character or escape sequence. It is primarily used in M to represent special characters such as tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds.

plays an important role in filtering data between multiple tables. When you load data, Power BI automatically looks for relationships that exist within the data by matching column names. You can also use Manage Relationships to edit these options manually.

Many-to-many (.) relationship:

  Describes a relationship where many values are in common between two tables.
  Does not require unique values in either table in a relationship.
  Is not recommended; a lack of unique values introduces ambiguity and your users might not know which column of values is referring to what.




3
MS Data Analyst
An example of a many-to-many relationship could be between the Sales and Order tables of a model on the OrderDate column because multiple sales can have multiple orders associated with them. Ambiguity is introduces because both tables can have the same order date.

A word of caution regarding bi-directional cross-filtering: You should not enable bi-directional cross-filtering relationships unless you fully understand the ramifications of doing so. Enabling it can lead to ambiguity, over-sampling, unexpected results, and potential performance degradation.Pa

To change the properties of data columns, go to the Model tab and select the columns you want to change. This will reveal the Properties pane, where you can do things like change the default summarization, hide the column, or set the number of decimal places to display.

Data granularity indicates the level the detail within the data, so the higher the granularity, the more detail that is represented in the data.

Cardinality is the measure of unique values in a table. An example of high cardinality would be a Sales table as it has a high number of unique values.

You can use hierarchies to create drill-down reports, where users can navigate through the levels of the hierarchy to view more detailed information. They can also be used to create calculations and measures that aggregate data at different levels of the hierarchy

To create a hierarchy in Power BI Desktop, go to the data view on your Power BI Desktop and select the top-level element. Right-click on that element and select ‘New hierarchy’. That will now create a new hierarchy with only the top-level element in it. To put the other elements on the hierarchy, simply drag them to the hierarchy

MS Data Analyst
Hierarchies are a way to organize data in a way where one element is ranked over the other. They allow you to drill up or down on your visual and reveal additional details.




11
MS Data Analyst
There are specific considerations and limitations for hierarchies in Power BI Desktop:

  Up to 10,000 items per hierarchy (across all datasets)
  Up to five hierarchies
  Up to five levels per hierarchy

When two model tables have multiple relationships, it could be because your model has a role-playing dimension. For example, if you have a table named Sales that includes two date columns, OrderDateKey and ShipDateKey, both columns are related to the Date column in the Date table. In this case, the Date table is described as a role-playing dimension because it could play the role of order date or ship date.

Power BI Desktop supports a feature called What-if parameters. When you create a what-if parameter, a calculated table is automatically added to your model.

What-if parameters allow report users to select or filter by values that are stored in the calculated table. Measure formulas can use selected value(s) in a meaningful way. 




15
MS Data Analyst
Notably, what-if calculated tables aren't related to other model tables because they're not used to propagate filters. For this reason, they're sometimes called disconnected tables.

You can write a DAX formula to add a calculated column to any table in your model. The formula is evaluated for each table row and it returns a single value. When added to a DirectQuery storage mode table, the formula is evaluated by the underlying source database when the table is queried.

In the Fields pane, calculated columns have the following icon.

A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund that is typically established by countries with large amounts of surplus income from natural resources, trade, or other sources. The purpose of a sovereign wealth fund is to invest the surplus income to generate long-term financial returns that can be used for various purposes such as supporting future generations, stabilizing the economy, or funding social welfare programs.

A service connection in Azure DevOps is a secure way to connect external services and resources to your Azure DevOps projects. These external services can include Azure subscriptions, repositories hosted on other platforms (such as GitHub or Bitbucket), container registries, and more.

Azure Dev Ops
You can create a service connection from Azure Pipelines to external and remote services for executing tasks in a job. Once you establish a connection, you can view, edit, and add security to the service connection. You can also manage different types of service connections with the az devops service-endpoint command3.

The design of your service connections should meet your organization’s requirements. Some companies prefer to create service connections per subscription to control the exposure of any given service principal to a specific subscription. Having a proper design saves time and solves the problem of too many service connections.
