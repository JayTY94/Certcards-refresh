Tokenization is the process of exchanging sensitive data for nonsensitive data called “tokens” that can be used in a database or internal system without bringing it into scope.  

Although the tokens are unrelated values, they retain certain elements of the original data commonly length or format so they can be used for uninterrupted business operations. The original sensitive data is then safely stored outside of the organization’s internal systems.

Data loss prevention (DLP) is a set of tools and processes used to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users. DLP software classifies regulated, confidential and business critical data and identifies violations of policies defined by organizations or within a predefined policy pack, typically driven by regulatory compliance such as HIPAA, PCI-DSS, or GDPR

Confusion
Confusion means that each binary digit (bit) of the ciphertext should depend on several parts of the key, obscuring the connections between the two.[2]
The property of confusion hides the relationship between the ciphertext and the key.
Confusion increases the ambiguity of ciphertext and it is used by both block and stream ciphers.
