Adversary
An adversary is an organization or threat actor responsible for leveraging a capability against a victim to fulfill its goals.

Capability
The capabilities refer to the tools and techniques used by an adversary in an event.

In Orchestrator, newly created queues are empty by default. To populate them with items you can either use the upload functionality in Orchestrator, or Studio activities. The latter also enable you to change item statuses and process them. As soon as queue items are processed, they become transactions.

 If at least one queue item exceeds its deadline, Over Capacity is displayed in the Necessary Robots (SLA) column and predictions are no longer calculated.

 Predictions are made for queue items with deadlines in the next 24 hours (can be changed using the Queue.SlaReadaheadTimeLimitHours, and do not take into account the items' defer dates.

In order to specify custom Item/Transaction fields for this project, I had to create a JSON schema document (on jsonschema.net/app/) to upload to the "Specific Data JSON Schema" field. There was a link to a web app for the creation of this document in the article "About Queues and Transactions".

RAID 6 is a data storage approach that combines four or more hard drives into a single logical drive. Compared to individual data carriers, it boosts reliability of the system and read speeds. The basis for this is the combination of striping and parity, that also forms the basis of RAID level 5. It comes as little surprise then that RAID 6 is often referred to as “RAID 5 expansion”.

 Wireless deauthentication is like a denial of service for a WAP that forces the client to attach to an evil twin that looks like the legitimate WAP. Once connected, the attacker can capture all of the information being sent through it. A sign of an evil twin is that internet access is slow but you cannot connect to the corporate network.

Failed or abandoned queue items can be assigned to a reviewer, which can be changed or cleared at any point, if needed. Each of these changes are tracked in the History tab of the Audit Details window. The reviewer is in charge of assessing the current status of the transactions he is assigned to, and changing the review status.

An attacker might see a bank transfer take place and then create their own API call that might transfer information into their account. This is called API injection and it’s another concern we have when making sure that our API applications are secure.

 The Priority of the items added in a queue after enabling SLA predictions is automatically set to High, regardless of how it was set in Studio or in the .csv file used for upload.

 You cannot delete a process associated to a queue with enabled SLA predictions.

The Transactions page displays the transactions from a given queue. It also shows their statuses, the dates when they should be processed, the Robot that processed them, and the type of exception thrown or assigned reference, if any.

Victim
A victim is a target against whom attacks are initiated, vulnerabilities are exploited, or capabilities are used. It can be organizations, people, or assets, such as target email or IP addresses, domains, and so on.

In the process a user is redirected to the Box web app in a browser where they log in and authorize the application access to their data before they are redirected back to the applications redirect_url. This last step requires the application to be running on a web server somewhere accessible to the user.

If an API has not been properly developed or tested, an attacker may be able to find a vulnerability that wouldn’t be able to use the functionality of the application, but it might be able to cause the application to fail. This would be a denial of service attack, and it would then prevent anyone else from gaining access to that application

To achieve better control in terms of Orchestrator performance, the Specific Data size of queue items is limited to 1 MB with the help of the Queue.MaxSpecificDataSizeInKiloBytes app setting. Anything beyond this limit cannot be added to a queue, and it returns the 403 - Payload Too Large error code.

If you configured multiple redirect URIs for the application, the authorization URL must include the redirect_uri parameter matching one of the URIs configured in the Box developer console. If the parameter is not specified, the user will see a redirect_uri_missing error and will not be redirected back to the app after granting application access.

One method used by attackers to be able to intercept and perhaps even change this API information, is an on-path attack. This is when the attacker sits in the middle of the conversation and is able to view all of the traffic going back and forth, and in many cases modify or replay some of the traffic it has seen in these API calls. This means that an attacker can sit in the middle of the conversation, get an understanding of the way the API operates, and then put their own data into the API flows.

The theory of the Diamond Model
This methodology underlines the relationships and characteristics of four components of the diamond—adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim. These four core elements are connected to delineate the relationship between each other which can be analytically examined to further uncover insights and gain knowledge of malicious activities.

When setting a Deadline or a Postpone date for an Orchestrator transaction, we recommend populating the respective fields with relative dates. For example, DateTime.Now.AddHours(2), DateTime.Now.AddDays(10) and DateTime.Now.Add(New System.TimeSpan(5, 0, 0, 0)). Additionally, you can use the US notation to add an exact time, such as 10/10/2019 07:40:00. Automatic correction of this date is available, for example, if you write 12 10 2019 9:0, it is automatically transformed to 12/10/2019 09:00:00.

Vertical Privilege Escalation
Vertical privilege escalation, also known as privilege elevation, is a term used in cybersecurity that refers to an attack that starts from a point of lower privilege, then escalates privileges until it reaches the level of the user or process it targets.




38
Security+
Horizontal Privilege Escalation
Horizontal privilege escalation means that a user will achieve access permissions belonging to another user that owns the same access level as the user that has started the cyberattack. It is a bit more challenging compared to vertical ones since they require a deep understanding of how operating systems work.
