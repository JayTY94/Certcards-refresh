Filtering Router
An inter-network router that selectively prevents the passage of data packets according to a security policy. A filtering router may be used as a firewall or part of a firewall. A router usually receives a packet from a network and decides where to forward it on a second network. A filtering router does the same, but first decides whether the packet should be forwarded at all, according to some security policy. The policy is implemented by rules (packet filters) loaded into the router.

Domain
A sphere of knowledge, or a collection of facts about some program entities or a number of network points or addresses, identified by a name. On the Internet, a domain consists of a set of network addresses. In the Internet's domain name system, a domain is a name with which name server records are associated that describe sub-domains or host. In Windows NT and Windows 2000, a domain is a set of network resources (applications, printers, and so forth) for a group of users. The user need only to log in to the domain to gain access to the resources, which may be located on a number of different servers in the network.

Adaptive cards in MS Teams are a way to create and send interactive cards that can be viewed and interacted with directly within a Teams chat or channel. They allow developers to customize the look and behavior of the cards to suit their needs, and can include a range of content types such as text, images, buttons, and more. Adaptive cards can be used for a variety of purposes, such as displaying information, collecting data, and conducting surveys.

Use guest access and external access to collaborate with people outside your organization:

Guest access - A feature that allows you to invite people from outside your organization to join a team. Guests can also call, chat, and meet with people in your organization and you can share files and folders with them. Invited people get an Azure AD B2B collaboration guest account in your directory.

Guests are added to your organization's Azure Active Directory as B2B collaboration users. They must sign in to Teams using their guest account. If the normally use Teams with another Microsoft 365 organization, they need to switch organizations in Teams to interact with your organization.

When you invite a guest to Teams, a guest account is created for them in Azure Active Directory and they are covered by the same compliance and auditing protection as other Microsoft 365 users. Guest access is subject to Azure AD and Microsoft 365 service limits.

Guests can leave the team at any time from within Teams. For details, see the article "How do I leave a team?". Leaving the team doesn't remove the guest account from our organization's directory. This must be done using a Microsoft 365 global admin or an Azure AD admin.

General
The Jaccard similarity algorithm is a measure used to compare the similarity of two sets. It is defined as the size of the intersection of two sets divided by the size of the union of the two sets. In other words, it measures how many elements are common to both sets out of the total number of distinct elements in both sets. The Jaccard similarity coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 meaning the sets are completely different and 1 meaning the sets are identical.

The group() method is a function provided by the re module in Python for working with regular expressions. It is used to extract portions of a matched pattern or capture groups.

When a regular expression pattern contains parentheses (), it defines a capture group. The group() method allows you to access the content matched by a specific capture group within a regular expression pattern.






15
Python
Here's how the re.search(pattern, string).group() method works:

group(0) or simply group(): It returns the entire matched string.
group(n): It returns the content matched by the capture group with index n. The index starts from 1 for the leftmost capture group in the pattern.

A Microsoft Teams team is built on top of a Microsoft 365 group. A Microsoft 365 group is a group of people who have common collaboration needs and can be used for email communication, file sharing, and calendaring.

When you create a new team in Microsoft Teams, a new Microsoft 365 group is created for the team. This group is used for storing the team's files, managing the team's calendar, and enabling the team's email communication.

There are some differences between Teams and 365 Groups. Teams is more focused on chat-based collaboration and video conferencing, while 365 Groups is more focused on email communication and file sharing.
