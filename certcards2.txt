Power BI
Q: Why is a 200 K-row table (40 MB PBIX) unlikely to be “too large” for Power BI Desktop?
A: Power BI regularly handles multi-million-row tables under 100 MB if well-modeled; a 200 K-row table is small. Performance issues usually stem from query complexity or broken folding, not raw size.





67
Power BI
Q: Why might using a Date dimension table improve model performance and simplify filters?
    A:

    A dedicated Date table lets you create one‐to‐many relationships to fact tables and use date‐intelligence DAX functions efficiently.

    It centralizes filters (e.g., Year, Quarter) rather than filtering on a date column in every fact, reducing the complexity of DAX queries that run during refresh or visual rendering.

The name of a FreeBSD interface starts with the name of its network driver. It is then followed by a number starting at 0 that increases incrementally by one for each additional interface sharing that driver. For example, a common driver used by Intel gigabit network interface cards is igb. The first such card in a firewall will be igb0, the second is igb1, and so on.





131
pfSense
pfSense software also transmits a unique and random “device key” to privately identify which backups belong to a given installation.

This device key must be unique to each firewall backing up its configuration. To do this the key is automatically generated by taking the SHA256 hash of the SSH service keys on the installation. This allows ACB to reliably and properly identify ownership of each backup in an anonymous way.

185
Power BI
Q: What is VertiPaq and why is it relevant when appending tables?
A: VertiPaq is Power BI’s in‐memory columnar engine. When appending tables with identical schemas, VertiPaq compresses and merges columns efficiently, making the in‐memory append step very fast.





186
Power BI
Why might SUMMARIZECOLUMNS yield better performance than SUMMARIZE?
The Tabular engine has built-in optimizations for SUMMARIZECOLUMNS that reduce temporary table materializations and merge identical aggregations, resulting in faster query plans, especially on large fact tables.





187
Power BI
Q: What are common pitfalls when manually partitioning with two queries?
A: Forgetting to disable History after its catch-up refresh (causes full pull), mismatched schemas between History & Recent, and letting the Historical table outgrow available memory.





188
Power BI
Q: How can Aggregations in Power BI speed up queries on large fact tables?
    A:

    Define a summarized (aggregated) table at a higher grain (e.g., daily sales totals) and point visuals to it for common queries.

    The engine stores both the detailed and aggregated tables; for queries that can be satisfied by the aggregate, Power BI never scans the full fact table, reducing query time dramatically.

389
Power BI
Q: How do incremental refresh policies handle late-arriving data, and what can you do to mitigate missed updates?
    A:

    Incremental refresh typically uses a RangeStart/RangeEnd window; any rows older than RangeStart aren’t re-queried.

    To capture late-arriving updates, include a “stale data window” (e.g., overlapping dates) so you reprocess recent partitions that might receive back‐dated changes, then drop duplicates in Power Query or DAX.





390
Power BI
Q: What are the two main components of query execution time when pulling data via SQL?
A: Fixed costs (connection setup, query plan, authentication, network latency) and variable costs (reading/transmitting each row). Reducing row count cuts the variable portion.





391
Power BI
What’s the scope of variables (VAR) inside an ADDCOLUMNS column definition?
A VAR declared inside one column’s definition lives only within that column. To share results, you must either repeat the logic or separate the columns into multiple ADDCOLUMNS calls so that the column values exist in the table.





392

445
Azure Files Documentation
Azure File Sync enables you to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Azure File Sync transforms an on-premises (or cloud) Windows Server into a quick cache of your SMB Azure file share.





446
Azure Files Documentation
You can back up your Azure file share via share snapshots, which are read-only, point-in-time copies of your share. Snapshots are incremental, meaning they only contain as much data as has changed since the previous snapshot. You can have up to 200 snapshots per file share and retain them for up to 10 years.





447
Azure Files Documentation
To assign share-level RBAC permissions to specific users or groups, on-premises AD DS identities must be synced to Microsoft Entra ID using Entra Connect Sync. If identities aren't synced, you must use a default share-level permission, which applies to all authenticated users

Q: What are the risks of using a static RangeStart parameter over a long period?
A: If you never update RangeStart, new “late-arriving” or back‐dated changes older than that date won’t be captured. You risk permanently missing updates unless you periodically advance the boundary.





459
Power BI
Q: What is the effect of data type mismatches on Power Query folding and performance?
    A:

    If you change a column’s data type (e.g., from text to date) before filtering, Power Query may break folding because the source might not support that conversion natively.

    Always apply type conversions at the end, after filters, or ensure the source can natively convert the type in the same query.





460
Power BI
Q: Why might switching to the Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector improve performance over the SQL connector?
A: The Dataverse connector is designed to leverage server‐side paging and API optimizations, often preserving query folding more reliably and avoiding TDS‐related throttling.

Use .resolve() to normalize, and ensure the target directory is a parent of the resolved path.





519
Python
limit the number of retries in a retry decorator by maintaining a counter within the decorator and exiting after reaching the maximum number of retries.

Example:
from functools import wraps

def retry(max_retries):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            attempts = 0
            while attempts < max_retries:
                try:
                    return func(*args, **kwargs)
                except Exception as e:
                    attempts += 1
                    print(f"Attempt {attempts} failed: {e}")
            raise Exception("Maximum retries exceeded")
        return wrapper
    return decorator





520
Python
Q:
How does using yield from affect the performance of a generator?

A:
yield from can improve performance by delegating part of the generator’s operations to another generator, reducing overhead and simplifying code.

Example:
def generator1():
    yield from range(1000)

def generator2():
    yield from generator1()

# More efficient delegation

Azure Files Documentation
File shares (preview), offered by the Microsoft.FileShares resource provider. File shares are a new top-level resource that simplify the deployment of Azure Files by eliminating the storage account. Unlike classic file shares, which must be deployed into a storage account, file shares are deployed directly into the resource group like storage accounts themselves





567
Azure Files Documentation
Using the storage account key to mount the Azure file share is effectively an administrator operation, because the mounted file share has full permissions to all of the files and folders on the share, even if they have ACLs. When using the storage account key to mount over SMB, the NTLMv2 authentication protocol is used.





568
Azure Files Documentation
Many important settings, such as network and security rules, are applied at the storage account level. You should consider the storage account to be a trust boundary and only place classic file shares in the same storage account if you're ok with them having the same security settings.





569

583
JavaScript Concepts
Promise.all() / allSettled() / race() / any()
Utilities to coordinate multiple promises:

  all: wait for all to succeed (or fail-fast)

  allSettled: wait for all to settle, regardless of outcome

  race: settle as soon as one settles

  any: succeed as soon as one fulfills (rejects if all reject)





584
JavaScript Concepts
Promise
An object representing the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation:
  Pending – neither fulfilled nor rejected

  Fulfilled – operation succeeded, value available

  Rejected – operation failed, reason available

608
Azure Files Documentation
SMB file shares communicate over port 445, which many organizations and internet service providers (ISPs) block for outbound (internet) traffic. This practice originates from legacy security guidance about deprecated and non-internet safe versions of the SMB protocol. SMB 3.x does not share these vulnerabilities.





609
Azure Files Documentation
In the OSI networking model, Microsoft SMB Protocol is most often used as an Application layer or a Presentation layer protocol, and it relies on lower-level protocols for transport. The transport layer protocol that Microsoft SMB Protocol is most often used with is NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT).

Terraform Codebox
Terraform provider blocks declare which cloud or service you're configuring. You must include a provider block like azurerm in the root module, even if the actual resources are defined in submodules.


hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  use_cli = true
}





620
Terraform Codebox
In a Terraform module, names like "main" or "this" are user-defined labels for a resource block. They are not reserved words — you can choose meaningful names to reference resources elsewhere in your config.


hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "this" { ... }
# Reference: azurerm_storage_account.this.name

DLP policies are how you monitor the activities that users take on sensitive items at rest, sensitive items in transit, or sensitive items in use and then take protective actions. For example, when a user attempts a prohibited action, like copying a sensitive item to an unapproved location or sharing medical information in an email, DLP can:

show a pop-up policy tip to the user that warns them that they might be trying to share a sensitive item inappropriately





635
Microsoft Purview
Run the policy in simulation mode, without Policy Tips and then use the DLP reports, and any incident reports, to assess the impact of the policies. You can use DLP reports to view the number, location, type, and severity of policy matches. Based on the results, you can fine-tune your policies as needed.





636

When viewed by users in your organization, an applied sensitivity label appears like a tag on apps and can be easily integrated into their existing workflows. Your sensitivity labels aren't visible in apps to users from other organizations, or to guests.





653
Microsoft Purview
Publish the labels. After your sensitivity labels are configured, publish them by using a label policy. Decide which users and groups should have the labels and what policy settings to use. A single label is reusable—you define it once, and then you can include it in several label policies assigned to different users.

SMB Multichannel enables clients to use multiple network connections that provide increased performance while lowering the cost of ownership. Increased performance is achieved through bandwidth aggregation over multiple NICs and utilizing Receive Side Scaling (RSS) support for NICs to distribute the I/O load across multiple CPUs.





677
Azure Files Documentation
You can access your Azure file shares over the public internet accessible endpoint, over one or more private endpoints on your network(s), or by caching your Azure file share on-premises with Azure File Sync (SMB file shares only).





678
Azure Files Documentation
To enable AD DS authentication over SMB for Azure file shares, you need to register your Azure storage account with your on-premises AD DS and then set the required domain properties on the storage account. To register your storage account with AD DS, you create a computer account (or service logon account) representing it in your AD DS.

Q:
How can generators be used to implement a producer-consumer pattern?

A:
Generators can act as producers by yielding data, which consumers can iterate over, allowing for efficient and decoupled data processing.

Example:
def producer():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i

def consumer(gen):
    for item in gen:
        print(f"Consumed: {item}")

gen = producer()
consumer(gen)





688
Python
Q:
How can you profile a generator to identify performance bottlenecks?

A:

Best Practices and Patterns





698
Python
Zip Slip (Path Traversal Attack)
Malicious zips can contain members like ../../etc/passwd.
Naïve extractall() writes outside the intended folder.
Fix: use Path.resolve() to normalize paths and ensure they remain within a safe directory.





699
Python
Forward References in Type Hints
Type hints can refer to classes not yet defined.
Solutions: quotes ("Node") or from __future__ import annotations.





700
Python
Front: What environment variable can you set so Python always knows where to find extra modules?
Back: PYTHONPATH, e.g.

bash
>>>
export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/project":$PYTHONPATH





701
Python
Q:
How can you memoize a generator function to cache its results?

A:
By using decorators like functools.lru_cache() on generator functions, although it's generally more suited for regular functions. For generators, you might need to implement custom caching.

Note:
functools.lru_cache() does not work directly with generator functions since they return iterators. Instead, consider converting the generator to a list and then caching.





702
Python
What does the any() function do when used with a generator expression?

A:
It returns True if any element of the generator is True, otherwise False. It evaluates elements lazily and stops as soon as a True is found.

Example:
result = any(x > 10 for x in gen())





703
Python
Pathlib (Path)
Modern replacement for os.path.
Supports intuitive operators (/ for joining paths), suffix checks, directory creation, and normalization with .resolve().





704
Python
Q:
What are the two essential methods that an iterator class must implement?

A:
__iter__() and __next__().





705
Python
Path.resolve()
Converts a path into an absolute, normalized path.
