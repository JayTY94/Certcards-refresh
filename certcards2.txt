General
Markdown is a lightweight markup language used in text editors and web applications to format and style text. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the goal of allowing people to write using an easy-to-read, plain-text format that could then be converted into HTML.

Markdown uses simple syntax, such as asterisks for bold text and hyphens for lists, to indicate formatting. The resulting text is easy to read and write, making it a popular choice for technical documentation, blogging, and note-taking.

Filtering Router
An inter-network router that selectively prevents the passage of data packets according to a security policy. A filtering router may be used as a firewall or part of a firewall. A router usually receives a packet from a network and decides where to forward it on a second network. A filtering router does the same, but first decides whether the packet should be forwarded at all, according to some security policy. The policy is implemented by rules (packet filters) loaded into the router.
