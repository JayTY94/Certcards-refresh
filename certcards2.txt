Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
If you need to terminate the container, use the kill command to send a kill signal. The container's kernel captures the kill signal, but the running process doesn't. This command forcefully terminates the working process in the container.

Lastly, to remove containers that are in a stopped state, use the remove command. After removing a container, all data stored in the container gets destroyed.

Python
In Python, you can compare sequences of the same type. When comparing two sequences, the first 
non-equal
 value determines the outcome.

For example, consider the following lists:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
more_numbers = [1, 2, 2, 10, 20]
When you compare these lists, you’ll find that numbers is greater than more_numbers.

Dataverse Plugins
Error Handling in Dataverse involves interpreting and managing error messages returned by the system during operations. Errors can arise from validation failures, plugin restrictions, permission issues, or data conflicts. Effective error handling requires understanding error codes, messages, and contextual details provided by the system. This enables developers to debug issues, enforce business rules, and provide meaningful feedback to users or calling applications.

sklearn
RandomizedSearchCV implements a randomized search over parameters, where each setting is sampled from a distribution over possible parameter values. This has two main benefits over an exhaustive search:
A budget can be chosen independent of the number of parameters and possible values.
Adding parameters that do not influence the performance does not decrease efficiency.

OAuth versus OpenID Connect: The platform uses OAuth for authorization and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0, so the terminology and flow are similar between the two.

Python
Authentication helps a service understand who you are. Typically, you provide your credentials to a server by passing data through the Authorization header or a custom header defined by the service. All the functions of Requests that you’ve seen to this point provide a parameter called auth, which allows you to pass your credentials:

>>> import requests

>>> response = requests.get(
...     "https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd",
...     auth=("user", "passwd")
... )

Container storage drives are less performant.

Containers implement a storage driver to allow your apps to write data. This driver introduces an extra abstraction to communicate with the host OS kernel, and is less performant than writing directly to a host filesystem.

Containers can make use of two options to persist data. The first option is to make use of volumes, and the second is bind mounts.

160
Azure Storage
If a change to one piece of data must result in a change to another piece of data, an application needs to group together a series of data updates. You can use transactions to group these updates.

A container image is immutable. Once you've built an image, you can't change it. The only way to change an image is to create a new image.

Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker containers provide security features to run multiple containers simultaneously on the same host without affecting each other. As we learned, we can configure both data storage and network configuration to isolate our containers or share data and connectivity between specific containers.





198
pandas
Column-Specific Operation with explode: You can apply explode to a specific column by passing the column name to DataFrame.explode. Other columns remain unaffected, with their values duplicated alongside the new rows, maintaining the DataFrame's structural integrity.





199
Python
More coding languages are supported in TensorFlow than in PyTorch, which has a C++ API. You can use TensorFlow in both JavaScript and Swift. If you don’t want to write much low-level code, then Keras abstracts away a lot of the details for common use cases so you can build TensorFlow models without sweating the details.

sklearn
Assuming that some data is Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) is making the assumption that all samples stem from the same generative process and that the generative process is assumed to have no memory of past generated samples.





205
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
To place a container in the run state, use the run command. You can also restart a container that's already running. When restarting a container, the container receives a termination signal to enable any running processes to shut down gracefully before the container's kernel terminates.





206
DNS
DNS Forwarders
DNS servers configured to forward queries they cannot resolve locally to external DNS servers. Forwarders help improve DNS resolution efficiency and reduce latency by directing unresolved queries to designated upstream servers.





207
Python
Because the decoding of bytes to a str requires an encoding scheme, Requests will try to guess the encoding based on the response’s headers if you don’t specify one. You can provide an explicit encoding by setting .encoding before accessing .text:

>>> response.encoding = "utf-8"  # Optional: Requests infers this.
>>> response.text
'{"current_user_url":"https://api.github.com/user", ...}'





208
Azure Functions
Just like the other triggers we've seen so far, you can create a blob trigger in the Azure portal. Inside your Azure function, select Blob trigger from the list of predefined trigger types. Then, enter the logic that you want to execute when a blob is created or updated.

One setting that's important to understand is the Path. The Path tells the blob trigger which blob container to monitor to see if a blob is uploaded or updated. By default, the Path value is:

samples-workitems/{name}

Workera.ai
Automatic Replication and Failover: Certain services, such as Azure Storage, automatically replicate data between region pairs. This replication helps ensure that your data is always available, even if one region experiences an outage. Additionally, Azure prioritizes the restoration of services in region pairs to ensure a quicker recovery time.

Diffusers Library
Markov Chain
A sequence of random variables where each state depends only on the previous one. In diffusion models, the noise addition process is modeled as a Markov chain, allowing controlled transitions from clear images to noisy ones and vice versa, simplifying the math for training.





219
MS Identity Platform
Authorization server - The Microsoft identity platform is the authorization server. Also called an identity provider or IdP, it securely handles the end-user's information, their access, and the trust relationships between the parties in the auth flow. The authorization server issues the security tokens your apps and APIs use for granting, denying, or revoking access to resources (authorization) after the user has signed in (authenticated).

Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
For more advanced scenarios, both Linux and Windows provide additional network options. For example, the overlay option creates a virtual switch from the host network, so containers on that network can get IP addresses from DHCP servers or operate with IP addresses from that network segment. Furthermore, Docker allows third-party vendors to create network plugins.





226
pandas
Handling Empty Lists and Missing Data in explode: The explode method gracefully handles empty lists and missing values (NaN) when you use DataFrame.explode. Empty lists result in no additional rows, while NaN values are propagated, ensuring DataFrame consistency after the operation.





227
Power BI
Power BI and API Calls: Power BI supports REST API calls, allowing data import from web services. The built-in Web connector is used for API integration but primarily supports GET requests. More complex methods like POST require manual M code configuration to handle the request body and headers.





228
Azure Functions
In an blob input binding definition:
      "path": "thumbnail-images/{filename}",
Provide the path, which specifies the container and the item name that goes in it. The path property is required when using the blob trigger, and should be provided in the style shown here, with curly braces around the filename portion of the path. This syntax creates a binding expression that allows you to reference the blob's name in other bindings, and in your function's code.

A volume is stored on the host filesystem at a specific folder location. Choose a folder where you know the data won't be modified by non-Docker processes.

Docker creates and manages the new volume by running the docker volume create command.
