Full-disk encryption (FDE) and self-encrypting drives (SED) encrypt data as it is written to the disk and decrypt data as it is read off the disk. FDE makes sense for laptops, which are highly susceptible to loss or theft. But FDE isn’t suitable for the most common risks faced in data center and cloud environments.

With Self-encrypting drives (SEDs), the operation of the disk, and its encryption and decryption, is transparent to the users who are reading and writing data. This default encryption and decryption mode is referred to as secure erase mode. In secure erase mode, you do not need an authentication key or password to decrypt and read data.

Salespeople connect to many different networks, including at events and hotels, therefore their laptops are connected to an air-gapped computer called a dirty computer to scan for malware. They also need to check that any presentation material that they obtained from events does not contain malware. This is done before they can connect to the network to ensure security and that they don't import malware into the company.

RAID 6 is a data storage approach that combines four or more hard drives into a single logical drive. Compared to individual data carriers, it boosts reliability of the system and read speeds. The basis for this is the combination of striping and parity, that also forms the basis of RAID level 5. It comes as little surprise then that RAID 6 is often referred to as “RAID 5 expansion”.

In the process a user is redirected to the Box web app in a browser where they log in and authorize the application access to their data before they are redirected back to the applications redirect_url. This last step requires the application to be running on a web server somewhere accessible to the user.

If you configured multiple redirect URIs for the application, the authorization URL must include the redirect_uri parameter matching one of the URIs configured in the Box developer console. If the parameter is not specified, the user will see a redirect_uri_missing error and will not be redirected back to the app after granting application access.

In Orchestrator, newly created queues are empty by default. To populate them with items you can either use the upload functionality in Orchestrator, or Studio activities. The latter also enable you to change item statuses and process them. As soon as queue items are processed, they become transactions.

Failed or abandoned queue items can be assigned to a reviewer, which can be changed or cleared at any point, if needed. Each of these changes are tracked in the History tab of the Audit Details window. The reviewer is in charge of assessing the current status of the transactions he is assigned to, and changing the review status.

To achieve better control in terms of Orchestrator performance, the Specific Data size of queue items is limited to 1 MB with the help of the Queue.MaxSpecificDataSizeInKiloBytes app setting.

When setting a Deadline or a Postpone date for an Orchestrator transaction, we recommend populating the respective fields with relative dates. For example, DateTime.Now.AddHours(2), DateTime.Now.AddDays(10) and DateTime.Now.Add(New System.TimeSpan(5, 0, 0, 0)). Additionally, you can use the US notation to add an exact time, such as 10/10/2019 07:40:00. Automatic correction of this date is available, for example, if you write 12 10 2019 9:0, it is automatically transformed to 12/10/2019 09:00:00.
