OAuth2.0
The spa redirect type is backward-compatible with the implicit flow. Apps currently using the implicit flow to get tokens can move to the spa redirect URI type without issues and continue using the implicit flow. Despite this backward compatibility, we recommend that you use the auth code flow with PKCE for SPAs.




15
RAG
One prevalent challenge when implementing language models through chat is the so-called groundedness, which refers to whether a response is rooted, connected, or anchored in reality or a specific context. In other words, groundedness refers to whether the response of a language model is based on factual information.




16
Azure Functions Quickstart
Before you can publish your Functions project to Azure, you must have a function app and related resources in your Azure subscription to run your code. The function app provides an execution context for your functions. When you publish from Visual Studio Code to a function app in Azure, the project is packaged and deployed to the selected function app in your Azure subscription.

variable = 'Suspicious value'




19
MS Identity Platform
Single-page applications: Also known as SPAs, these are web apps in which tokens are acquired by a JavaScript or TypeScript app running in the browser. Many modern apps have a single-page application at the front end that's primarily written in JavaScript. The application often uses a framework like Angular, React, or Vue. MSAL.js is the only Microsoft Authentication Library that supports single-page applications.




20
MS Identity Platform
Integrated Windows Authentication has been replaced with a more reliable way of getting tokens silently - WAM. WAM can login the current windows user silently. This workflow does not require complex setup and it even works for personal (Microsoft) accounts. Internally, the Windows Broker (WAM) will try several strategies to get a token for the current Windows user, including IWA and redeeming the PRT. This eliminates most of the limitations with IWA.




21
Python
The purpose of the .__init__() method in a Python class is to initialize instance attributes.

When you create an instance of a class, Python automatically calls .__init__() using the same arguments that you’ve passed to the constructor. This method sets up the initial state of the object by assigning values to instance attributes.




22
sklearn 
In the basic approach of cross-validation, called k-fold CV, the training set is split into k smaller sets. The following procedure is followed for each of the k “folds”:

A model is trained using k-1 of the folds as training data;
the resulting model is validated on the remaining part of the data (i.e., it is used as a test set to compute a performance measure such as accuracy).




23
PP365
Grids: Grids are tabular representations of data within a model-driven app in Power Apps. They allow users to view and interact with rows of data from a table.

34
Power BI
To define a column in Power BI (DAX) that takes the non-blank value between two existing columns, or remains blank if both are blank, you can use the COALESCE function. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

NewColumn = COALESCE([Column1], [Column2])




35
Python
To make a request to GitHub’s authenticated user API, you first need to generate a personal access token with the read:user scope. Then you can pass this token as the second element in a tuple to get():

>>> import requests
>>> token = "<YOUR_GITHUB_PA_TOKEN>"
>>> response = requests.get(
...     "https://api.github.com/user",
...     auth=("", token)
... )




36
sklearn
The k-means algorithm divides a set of N samples into X an K disjoint clusters C, each described with the mean mu_j of the samples in the cluster. The means are commonly called the cluster "centroids"; note that they are not, in general, points from X, although they live in the same space.




37
OData
$orderby
The $orderby query option lets clients specify the order in which the data should be returned. For instance, you can use it to sort a list of entities in ascending or descending order based on specific properties, such as sorting products by price.




38
sklearn 
An alternative to cross-validation, bootstrapping involves repeatedly sampling data with replacement and evaluating model performance across these samples. It’s effective for small datasets, providing robust estimates of model variance but may not reflect real test distributions as accurately as cross-validation.

Azure Key Vault Secrets
Key Vault also supports a contentType field for secrets. Clients may specify the content type of a secret to help interpreting the secret data when it's retrieved. The maximum length of this field is 255 characters. The suggested usage is as a hint for interpreting the secret data. For instance, an implementation may store both passwords and certificates as secrets, then use this field to differentiate.




43
Diffusers Library
Conditioning
The process of guiding model output by adding information, such as text prompts or class labels. Conditioning allows the model to generate images aligned with specific instructions, enabling customizable and context-aware image creation.




44
OData Requests
Edm.Decimal:
A data type used in OData protocols to represent decimal numbers. Conflicts can occur when values are formatted incorrectly or incompatible with API settings, such as IEEE754Compatible, which controls floating-point number representation.




45
Python
Augmented assignment operators provide a more concise way to update the value of a variable. For example, counter += 1 is a shorthand for counter = counter + 1.

These operators rely on special methods like .__iadd__() for in-place operations. If the data type is mutable, then Python performs the operation in place. If the data type is immutable, Python returns a new object with the updated value.




46
Diffusers Library
Noise Schedule
A sequence controlling the amount of noise added to images at each diffusion step. This progressive reduction allows the model to learn to denoise by removing specific levels of noise at each step, eventually generating a clear image from the noise.




47
sklearn
By default, parameter search uses the score function of the estimator to evaluate a parameter setting. These are the sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score for classification and sklearn.metrics.r2_score for regression. For some applications, other scoring functions are better suited (for example in unbalanced classification, the accuracy score is often uninformative). An alternative scoring function can be specified via the scoring parameter of most parameter search tools.

50
Azure Functions
A trigger is an object that defines a specific function. For example, if you want a function to execute every 10 minutes, you could use a timer trigger.

Every function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to execute a piece of logic that runs under multiple conditions, you need to create multiple functions that share the same core function code.




51
Kaggle
Once we've identified the shape of the trend, we can attempt to model it using a time-step feature. We've already seen how using the time dummy itself will model a linear trend:
target = a * time + b

We can fit many other kinds of trend through transformations of the time dummy. If the trend appears to be quadratic (a parabola), we just need to add the square of the time dummy to the feature set, giving us:
target = a * time ** 2 + b * time + c




52
Python
Many popular machine learning algorithms and datasets are built into TensorFlow and are ready to use. In addition to the built-in datasets, you can access Google Research Datasets or use Google’s Dataset Search to find even more.




53
Power BI
Certain types of views aren't included in performance measurements. For example, when a user selects a link to a report in an email message, the Report View is accounted for in the report usage but there is no event in the performance metrics.




54
Python
The first bit of information that you can gather from Response is the status code. A status code informs you of the status of the request.

For example, a 200 OK status means that your request was successful, whereas a 404 NOT FOUND status means that the resource you were looking for wasn’t found. There are many other possible status codes as well to give you specific insights into what happened with your request.

Not all configured policy conditions were satisfied. For example, the user is excluded from the policy or the policy only applies to certain trusted named locations.




66
Diffusers Library
Most models take a noisy sample, and each timestep it predicts the noise residual (other models elarn to predict the previous sample directly or hte velcity or v-prediction), the difference between a less noisy image and the input image. You can mix and match models to create other diffusion systems.




67
MS Identity Platform
OpenID Connect versus SAML: The platform uses both OpenID Connect and SAML to authenticate a user and enable single sign-on. SAML authentication is commonly used with identity providers such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) federated to Microsoft Entra ID, so it's often used in enterprise applications.




68

73
Diffusers Documentation
The Stable Diffusion model is a good starting point, and since its official launch, several improved versions have also been released. However, using a newer version doesn’t automatically mean you’ll get better results. You’ll still have to experiment with different checkpoints yourself, and do a little research (such as using negative prompts) to get the best results.




74

94
Power BI
If there are data sources being accessed within the partition, and data flowing in from other partitions, the Firewall loses its ability to be the gatekeeper, since the data flowing in could be leaked to one of the internally accessed data sources without it knowing about it. Thus the Firewall prevents a partition that accesses other partitions from being allowed to directly access any data sources.




95
Python
In Python, arithmetic operators are supported by corresponding magic methods. For example, the + operator is supported by .__add__(), and the - operator is supported by .__sub__().

To customize headers, you pass a dictionary of HTTP headers to get() using the headers parameter. For example, you can change your previous search request to highlight matching search terms in the results by specifying the text-match media type in the Accept header:

import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.github.com/search/repositories",
    params={"q": '"real python"'},
    headers={"Accept": "application/vnd.github.text-match+json"},

MS Identity Platform
Authorization server - The Microsoft identity platform is the authorization server. Also called an identity provider or IdP, it securely handles the end-user's information, their access, and the trust relationships between the parties in the auth flow. The authorization server issues the security tokens your apps and APIs use for granting, denying, or revoking access to resources (authorization) after the user has signed in (authenticated).




282
Python
Python fully supports arithmetic between ints and floats. It will convert narrower numbers to match their less narrow counterparts when used with the binary arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, and %). When division with /, // returns the quotient and % returns the remainder. Python considers ints narrower than floats. So, using a float in an expression ensures the result will be a float too. However, when doing division, the result will always be a float, even if only integers are used.

Running pip install within a Jupyter notebook is straightforward: you prefix the command with an exclamation mark (!). This tells the notebook to execute the command as a shell command rather than Python code. For example:

python
!pip install ipywidgets

After installing, remember to restart the kernel to ensure the notebook recognizes the new packages.

OData
Service Document
The service document is the entry point for an OData service. It provides metadata about the available entity sets and other resources that the client can interact with. The document acts as a map, allowing the client to discover what data is exposed via the OData service.




307
Python
Sessions are used to persist parameters across requests. For example, if you want to use the same authentication across multiple requests, then you can use a session:

import requests

TOKEN = "<YOUR_GITHUB_PA_TOKEN>"

with requests.Session() as session:
    session.auth = TokenAuth(TOKEN)

    first_response = session.get("https://api.github.com/user")
    second_response = session.get("https://api.github.com/user")




308
Dataverse Queries
Pagination and $top
Definition: Pagination refers to breaking down large sets of data into smaller, more manageable chunks. The $top query parameter controls how many records are returned in a single request.
Relevance: For performance reasons, Dataverse limits the number of records returned in a single API request. Pagination, along with $top, helps in retrieving large datasets incrementally without overwhelming the system.

Authentication helps a service understand who you are. Typically, you provide your credentials to a server by passing data through the Authorization header or a custom header defined by the service. All the functions of Requests that you’ve seen to this point provide a parameter called auth, which allows you to pass your credentials:

>>> import requests

>>> response = requests.get(
...     "https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd",
...     auth=("user", "passwd")
... )

Azure Functions
By default, functions have a timeout of five (5) minutes. This timeout is configurable to a maximum of 10 minutes. If your function requires more than 10 minutes to execute, you can host it on a VM. Additionally, if your service is initiated through an HTTP request and you expect that value as an HTTP response, the timeout is further restricted to 2.5 minutes.

MS Identity Platform
OAuth versus OpenID Connect: The platform uses OAuth for authorization and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0, so the terminology and flow are similar between the two. You can even both authenticate a user (through OpenID Connect) and get authorization to access a protected resource that the user owns (through OAuth 2.0) in one request.
