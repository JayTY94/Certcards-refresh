Margins include the border area, or edge, around each page. Having a consistently spaced border area frames the report objects.

Because there isn't a report page property to set margins, it's up to you to lay out objects in way that results in a consistent border area. Margin sizes should be equal on the left and right, with possible variation on the top and bottom. Space across the top or bottom can show branding, titles, slicers, or other information that needs to be separated from the visuals.

As enterprises grow, so does their data. Often, strict requirements and regulations must be applied to ensure that this sensitive data is secure. Power BI provides a few different ways to help you accomplish this task:

Use Microsoft sensitivity labels to label dashboards, reports, semantic models, and dataflows by using the same taxonomy that is used to classify and protect files in Microsoft 365.
Add more protection measures such as encryption and watermarks when you are exporting the data.
Use Microsoft Cloud App Security to monitor and investigate activities in Power BI.

When building dashboards, you can create a cohesive picture by applying the same theme as in your reports. Or apply a specific theme to reports and dashboards so that all report elements or tiles are uniform.

This consideration is important when you're building multiple dashboards. Power BI provides options to apply a theme directly to a dashboard as well as all visuals of a report.





135
DAX Studio
The EVALUATE keyword is automatically included by Power BI in every query. Itâ€™s used to answer and create your visuals in Power BI. Itâ€™s also used to contain table expressions in a DAX query. You canâ€™t pair EVALUATE with a scalar value such as a measure or a number. You can only use EVALUATE with table expressions.

When a requirement is in place to lay out many slicers, consider creating a page that is dedicated to showing all slicers. For example, the page could be named Slicers. Sync the slicers to other pages and then set the slicers as hidden on those pages. This design technique will require that report consumers should always go to the Slicers page to modify slicer settings.

The simplest way to show details is to use drillable visuals. The matrix visual is an excellent choice because it allows drilling on rows and/or columns. Therefore, by assigning hierarchies or multiple fields, report consumers can drill to the level of detail that they want. For example, the matrix rows could show years, and the report consumer could drill down to quarter, month, and date levels.





165
MS Data Analyst
When you create visuals, Power BI Desktop aggregates your data into groups, based on the values that it finds in the underlying data. You can refine how those default groups are presented. You can also create new groups by grouping two or more data points in a visual or putting values into equal-sized groups (binning).

Occasionally, it might make sense to have a single report with many pages. Other times, it could make sense to separate pages into different reports. This scenario is especially true when you design those pages for a different audience or when you need to secure, share, or distribute them differently. Reports are a security and publication unit, and report pages belong to reports and can't be secured or published independently of the report.

Azure VDI Project
Azure now has a service, Azure Image Builder, for defining and creating your own custom images. Azure Image Builder is built on Packer, so you can even use your existing Packer shell provisioner scripts with it. To get started with Azure Image Builder, see Create a Windows VM with Azure Image Builder.






2
Azure VDI Project
Packer authenticates with Azure using a service principal. An Azure service principal is a security identity that you can use with apps, services, and automation tools like Packer. You control and define the permissions as to what operations the service principal can perform in Azure.






3
Azure VDI Project
To build images, you create a template as a JSON file. In the template, you define builders and provisioners that carry out the actual build process. Packer has a builder for Azure that allows you to define Azure resources, such as the service principal credentials created in the preceding step.

Azure VDI Project
Packer uses the HashiCorp Configuration Language - HCL - designed to allow concise descriptions of the required steps to get to a build file. The main purpose of the HCL language is defining builds and sources. All other language features exist only to make the definition of builds more flexible and convenient.




5
Azure VDI Project
In HCL, Blocks are containers for other content and usually represent the same kind of object, like a source. Blocks have a block type, can have zero or more labels, and have a body that contains any number of arguments and nested blocks. Most of Packer's features are controlled by top-level blocks in a configuration file.




6
Azure VDI Project
In HCL: 
	  Arguments assign a value to a name. They appear within blocks.
    Expressions represent a value, either literally or by referencing and combining other values. They appear as values for arguments, or within other expressions.




7
Azure VDI Project
The HCL language uses configuration files that are named with the .pkr.hcl file extension. Configuration files must always use UTF-8 encoding, and by convention are usually maintained with Unix-style line endings (LF) rather than Windows-style line endings (CRLF), though both are accepted.

It is important to use the correct type of quotes for your shell. In most shells, including PowerShell, single quotes and double quotes have different behavior. Single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, while double quotes allow for variable expansion and command substitution. So, if you are using PowerShell, you should use single quotes to enclose the value that you are assigning to the variable.

Azure Virtual Desktop gives you options to load balance users on your VM host pools. Host pools are collections of VMs with the same configuration assigned to multiple users




19
Azure VDI Project
 For the best performance, you can configure load balancing to occur as users sign in (breadth mode). With breadth mode, users are sequentially allocated across the host pool for your workload.

Desktop - Remote Desktop application groups give users access to a full desktop. You can provide a desktop where the session host VM resources are shared or pooled. Or you can provide personal desktops to users that need to be able to add or remove programs without impacting other users.





2
Azure VDI Project
App - RemoteApp applications groups provide users access to the applications you individually publish to the application group. You can create multiple RemoteApp app groups to accommodate different user scenarios. Use RemoteApp to virtualize an app that runs on a legacy OS or one that needs secured access to corporate resources.





3
Azure VDI Project
Images - When you configure session hosts for application groups, you have your choice of images. Use a recommended image like Windows 10 Enterprise multi-session + Office 365. Or choose another image in your gallery or an image provided by Microsoft or other publishers. You can also use your own image built through Hyper-V or on an Azure VM.





4
Azure VDI Project
Use either Microsoft Entra Domain Services or Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to authenticate at the service layer of Azure Virtual Desktop. All VMs in Azure Virtual Desktop are domain-joined. Microsoft Entra Domain Services or AD DS is used to authenticate users to the VMs.






5
Azure VDI Project
A workspace is a logical grouping of application groups in Azure Virtual Desktop. When a user signs in to Azure Virtual Desktop, they see a workspace with a desktop or applications published to the application groups assigned to them.






6
Azure VDI Project
To provide the best experience for your Azure Virtual Desktop users, use FSLogix profiles. FSLogix is designed to roam profiles in remote computing environments, such as Azure Virtual Desktop. User profiles are stored in per-user VHD or VHDX files. At sign-in, this profile container is dynamically attached to the computing environment. The user profile is immediately available and appears in the system exactly like a native user profile.




7
Azure VDI Project
To use FSLogix to separate user profiles from the session host virtual machines (VM), weâ€™ll need to configure Azure Storage and create an FSLogix profile share. These steps vary depending on the storage type and whether youâ€™re using Microsoft Entra Domain Services or Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
