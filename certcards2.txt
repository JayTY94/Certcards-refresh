Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker images are large files that are initially stored on your PC, and we need tools to manage these files.

The Docker CLI and Docker Desktop allow us to manage images by building, listing, removing, and running them. We manage Docker images by using the docker client. The client doesn't execute the commands directly, and sends all queries to the dockerd daemon.





253
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker provides us with the docker stats command. This command returns information for the container such as percentage CPU usage, percentage memory usage, I/O written to disk, network data sent and received, and process IDs assigned. This information is useful as an immediate data stream; however, no aggregation is done, because the data isn't stored. We'd have to install third-party software for meaningful data capture over a period of time.





254
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
To pause a running container, use the pause command. This command suspends all processes in the container.
