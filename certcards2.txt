115
FSLogix
Q: What is the purpose of the Office 365 Container in FSLogix?
A: The Office 365 Container isolates and stores Office-specific data (like Outlook cache, OneDrive files, and Teams settings), improving performance and reducing load times for Office apps in virtual desktop environments.





116
FSLogix
Q: Which format does FSLogix use to store user profile data?
A: FSLogix uses the VHDX (Virtual Hard Disk) format to store user profile data in containers.





117
FSLogix
During a first-time sign-in, FSLogix creates the container for the user in C:\ProgramData\FSLogix\Cache and mounts the container to the virtual machine. Next, FSLogix sets up all the necessary redirections for the user's profile. Then the User Profile Service creates the user's profile into the local cache.





118
FSLogix
Q: Where are FSLogix Profile Containers typically stored in Azure Virtual Desktop environments?
A: FSLogix Profile Containers are typically stored in Azure Files or network shares (SMB share) to allow consistent access across different virtual desktop sessions.





119
FSLogix
Cloud Cache uses the locally mounted container to provide periodic updates to the remote storage providers. Cloud Cache is designed to insulate users from short-term or intermittent local (inner-region, close proximity) storage issues.





120
FSLogix
Q: What is the main difference between FSLogix Profile Containers and traditional roaming profiles?
A: FSLogix uses VHDX containers to store user profiles, ensuring portability and faster logons, while traditional roaming profiles can become fragmented and inconsistent across multiple virtual machines.





121
FSLogix
On a lazy asynchronous operation, Cloud Cache flushes the changes to all storage providers simultaneously as each provider is flushed on its own thread. FSLogix doesn't throttle this operation and utilizes as much throughput as the system will allow.





122
FSLogix
All data written to the user's profile is temporarily stored as block-level cache objects in the same directory. Those block-level cache objects are then committed to the local cache. Before the block-level cache objects are created, the writes into the user's profile are processed in memory through a proxy file.





123
FSLogix
Q: How does FSLogix Profile Container enhance multi-session environments like Azure Virtual Desktop?
A: In multi-session environments, FSLogix Profile Containers ensure that user profiles are loaded quickly and consistently, regardless of which session or virtual machine the user logs into, ensuring a persistent and smooth experience even when multiple users share the same infrastructure.

FSLogix
Q: What is FSLogix App Masking, and how does it relate to managing applications in virtual desktops?
A: FSLogix App Masking is a feature that allows administrators to control which applications are visible to which users in a virtual desktop environment. This "masks" applications based on user roles, ensuring that users only see the apps they have permissions for, without the need for separate application installations.





275
FSLogix
Cloud Cache uses storage providers based on the order of entries in CCDLocations.
Storage providers should be listed in order of proximity, then preference.
Only one (1) provider is used when data is hydrated from the storage provider.





276
FSLogix
Q: What happens to a FSLogix Profile Container when a user logs off?
A: When a user logs off, the changes made to the profile are saved back into the Profile Container (VHDX file), ensuring that all settings and data are retained for the next session.





277
FSLogix
Q: How does FSLogix improve Office 365 performance in Azure Virtual Desktop?
A: FSLogix isolates Office 365 data (such as Outlook, Teams, OneDrive) in a container (VHDX), reducing load times and ensuring that data is quickly accessible without syncing delays.





278
FSLogix
Using Cloud Cache puts a performance and storage requirement on the virtual machine to accommodate the extra I/O operations and storage required by the local cache.





279
FSLogix
A full VHD(x) clone is performed when Cloud Cache determines, at sign in, that a storage provider isn't at the same sequence. During this operation, all pending writes are kept in the local cache until all storage providers are at the same sequence. Once complete, the flush operation begins sending new data to the storage providers.





280
FSLogix
During a user's session when the connection to any storage provider becomes unhealthy, FSLogix queues up all the changes and then flushes them to the providers when they return to a healthy state.





281
FSLogix
Cloud Cache operates the user's profile from the local cache during the user's session and must be configured with one or more remote storage providers as specified in CCDLocations. These remote storage providers store copies of the local cache and are used during the current session and for subsequent sign ins.





282
FSLogix
Data is written to all storage providers regardless of which provider is used during data hydration.
Performance (latency, utilization, bottlenecks) of a storage provider affects its sync status with the local copy.
Having one (1) or more provider that is behind in updates from local cache could be an indicator of an under performing storage provider.





283
FSLogix
Q: What is the role of Profile Disk Differencing in FSLogix?
A: Profile Disk Differencing allows FSLogix to create differencing VHDX disks, where changes to the user profile are stored in separate files, reducing the load on the main profile disk. This improves performance by ensuring faster read/write operations and reducing storage overhead.

Interval Funds May Provide Higher Yields and Diversification:
Interval funds often seek higher returns or income by investing in less liquid, alternative assets, potentially enhancing portfolio diversification beyond traditional stocks and bonds.

Front: How do you configure TTL in Cosmos DB, and what does it do?
Back: Set a TTL (in seconds) at the container level (default) or override per item; Cosmos DB automatically deletes items after they expire.





586
Azure Developer Associate
Front: List three criteria for choosing a good logical partition key.
Back:

High cardinality (many distinct values)
Even distribution of reads/writes (avoids “hot” partitions)
Co-location of related items if you need cross-item transactions.

Front: How does Cosmos DB decide when to split a physical partition?
Back: When either data size nears 20 GB or provisioned throughput demand exceeds the single-partition RU/s limit (~10 000 RU/s).





588
Azure Developer Associate
Front: What are the three throughput models in Cosmos DB?
Back:

Manual (Provisioned) RU/s – fixed throughput you set.
Autoscale RU/s – scales between 10% and 100× your minimum RU/s.
Serverless – no provisioned RUs; pay per RU consumed.

Front: You need to guarantee “no gaps” in the sequence of writes but don’t care about client affinity. Which consistency level?
Back: Consistent Prefix—it ensures write order, even if you see older data.





591
Azure Developer Associate
Front: What guarantee does Session consistency provide?
Back: Monotonic reads, monotonic writes, read-your-writes, and write-fan-out within a single client session.





592
Azure Developer Associate
Front: Describe the difference between Bounded Staleness and Consistent Prefix.
Back:
Bounded Staleness: Ordered reads with a max lag of K versions or T seconds.
Consistent Prefix: Ordered reads with no freshness bound (can lag indefinitely).

Front: How do you exclude a nested JSON property (/address/zip) from indexing?
Back:
{
  "indexingMode": "Consistent",
  "includedPaths": [ { "path": "/*" } ],
  "excludedPaths": [ { "path": "/address/zip/?" } ]
}

Front: Why might you choose Serverless over Autoscale?
Back: For very low-volume or unpredictable workloads where even Autoscale’s 10%-of-max RU floor is too costly.

Azure Developer Associate
Front: What’s the max data size and RU/s throughput a single logical partition can hold?
Back:

Data: up to 20 GB per logical partition
Throughput: limited to the RU/s of its parent physical partition (≈10 000 RU/s per slice).
