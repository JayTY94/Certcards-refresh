Q: Which formatter attribute includes the name of the function where the log message originated in Python's logging.Formatter?

A: %(funcName)s
This attribute inserts the function name into the log message, providing context about where the log was generated.

Azure AI Search
You can run indexers on demand or on a recurring data refresh schedule that runs as often as every five minutes. More frequent updates preclude the use of indexers, requiring that you implement a 'push model' that simultaneously pushes data to both Azure AI Search and your external data source.

PEP 8
No Spaces Around = for Keyword Arguments: Do not use spaces around the = sign when passing keyword arguments in function calls. This rule differentiates keyword arguments from assignment statements.

Logging in Python
Q: How can you configure logging using an external INI-style configuration file in Python's logging module?

A: Use logging.config.fileConfig('logging.ini') from the logging.config module
This function reads the logging configuration from an INI file, allowing for external and reusable configurations.

local.settings.json
A configuration file used during local development of Azure Functions. It stores environment variables, connection strings, and other settings required to run functions locally. This file is not deployed to Azure, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure during development.





437
Logging in Python
Q: Why is it recommended to use named loggers (e.g., logging.getLogger(__name__)) instead of the root logger?

A: It allows for more granular control over logging behavior in different parts of an application.
Named loggers enable targeted configurations, such as setting different log levels or handlers for specific modules.





438
Logging in Python
Q: What is the purpose of a Formatter in Python's logging module?

A: To define the structure and content of log messages using formats like '%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'.
This ensures that log messages are consistently formatted for readability and analysis.

Email Auth and Security
Aggregate Reports

Summary reports sent periodically (usually daily) to domain owners detailing email authentication results.
Provide insights into SPF and DKIM alignment and the overall effectiveness of DMARC policies.
Typically formatted in XML, containing data on email sources, authentication outcomes, and policy actions.





440
Logging in Python
Q: What is the primary purpose of TimedRotatingFileHandler from the logging.handlers module?

A: To rotate log files at specific timed intervals, such as daily or hourly (when='midnight').
This ensures that log files are segmented based on time, facilitating organized log management.





441
Logging in Python
Q: How do you add a custom filter to a logger or handler in Python's logging module?

A: Use the addFilter() method with a filter instance, e.g., logger.addFilter(SpecialFilter()).
This allows selective logging based on custom criteria defined within the filter.





442
Logging in Python
Q: How can you configure Python's logging to output messages to a file instead of the console?

A: Use FileHandler from the logging module with a filename like 'app.log'.
This directs log messages to the specified file instead of the standard console output.





443
Logging in Python
Q: What is the purpose of the disable_existing_loggers key in a dictConfig logging configuration?

A: disable_existing_loggers=False in logging.config.dictConfig
This ensures that existing loggers not specified in the configuration remain active and are not disabled.





444
Logging in Python
Q: Name the four main types of file handlers available in Python's logging module.

A: FileHandler, RotatingFileHandler, TimedRotatingFileHandler, WatchedFileHandler
These handlers manage log output to files with varying rotation and monitoring capabilities.

Logging in Python
Q: In TimedRotatingFileHandler from the logging.handlers module, what does the when parameter specify?

A: when='midnight'
This parameter sets the interval type for rotating logs, such as daily at midnight.

Home Network Project
Front: Explain the difference between a Docker Image and a Docker Container.

Back:
Docker Image: A read-only template that contains the application and all its dependencies required to run it. Images are built from Dockerfiles and serve as the blueprint for containers.
Docker Container: A runnable instance of a Docker image. Containers are created from images and can be started, stopped, moved, and deleted independently.





448
Logging in Python
Q: What does setting logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL) do to the logging system in Python's logging module?

A: It disables all logging messages at or below the CRITICAL level.
This effectively silences all log messages, as CRITICAL is the highest standard logging level.

Azure Functions
Durable Functions allows you to define stateful workflows using an orchestration function. An orchestration function provides these extra benefits:
You can define the workflows in code. You don't need to write a JSON description or use a workflow design tool.
Functions can be called both synchronously and asynchronously. Output from the called functions is saved locally in variables and used in subsequent function calls.

PP365
System-Assigned Managed Identity
A type of managed identity in Azure that is directly tied to an individual Azure resource, such as an Azure Function. The lifecycle of a system-assigned managed identity is bound to the resource; it is automatically created when enabled and deleted when the resource is removed.

Front: What is Network Latency and how can it affect network performance?

Back: Network Latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination across a network. High latency can result in delays, slow application performance, lag in real-time communications, and poor user experiences, especially in activities like gaming, video conferencing, and streaming.

2. Suppose your Azure Function has a blob trigger associated with it and you want it to execute only when png images are uploaded. Which of the following blob trigger Path values should you use? 

samples-workitems/{name}.png
The Path tells the blob trigger where it should monitor for changes, and if there are any filters applied. Adding a file extension to the Path specifies that uploaded files must have that file extension in order for the trigger to invoke the function.

Front: What is Rate Limiting and how does it help in preventing attacks?

Back: Rate Limiting restricts the number of requests a user or IP address can make to a service within a specific time frame. It helps prevent various attacks, such as brute-force attacks, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and abuse of APIs, by limiting the potential impact of malicious activities.

Front: What is Fail2Ban and how does it protect a network?

Back: Fail2Ban is an intrusion prevention software that monitors log files for suspicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts. When such patterns are detected, Fail2Ban automatically updates firewall rules to temporarily or permanently ban offending IP addresses, protecting the network from brute-force attacks and unauthorized access.

Front: How does Pi-hole utilize DNS Sinkholing to block ads?

Back: Pi-hole intercepts DNS queries for domains listed in its blocklists. Instead of resolving these domains to their legitimate IP addresses, Pi-hole returns a non-routable IP address (e.g., 0.0.0.0), preventing the ad content from loading on the client devices.

Front: What is Snort and how is it used in network security?

Back: Snort is an open-source network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS). It analyzes network traffic in real-time, using predefined rules to detect malicious activities such as exploits, port scans, and unauthorized access attempts. Snort can be integrated into pfSense to enhance network security by identifying and responding to potential threats.
