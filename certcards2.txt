Workspaces offer the following benefits:

  Focused collaboration efforts. You can use workspaces to house reports and dashboards for use by multiple teams.
  Ability to share and present reports and dashboards in a single environment.
  Assurance that the highest level of security is maintained by controlling who can access semantic models, reports, and dashboards.

By default, cross filtering (or cross highlighting) works between any two visuals. However, the report author can edit visual interactions between any pair of visuals and in either direction. Then, they can disable cross filtering or modify the interaction to use cross highlighting instead.

The Display state for Bookmarks captures the visibility of report objects, such as shapes, images, buttons, and text boxes.





56
MS Data Analyst
Because bookmarks can capture filter state, when invoked, they will apply that filter state. You can invoke bookmarks directly from the Bookmarks pane, or you can invoke them indirectly by selecting a button, image, or shape.

MS Data Analyst
Bookmarks capture a specific view of a report, including filters, slicers, the page selection, and the state of visuals. Report authors and report consumers can create them.

Bookmarks that are created by a report consumer are known as personal bookmarks





60
MS Data Analyst
No performance is impacted by having hidden visuals on a page. Hidden visuals don't run queries. Swapping visuals will provide flexible consumption options to the report consumer while retaining optimal performance and making the most out of the report page space.





61
MS Data Analyst
The Data state captures anything that impacts the queries that Power BI sends to the semantic model. For example, if a slicer is included in the scope of the bookmark, the Data state retains the applied slicer items when the bookmark was created (or updated). It will also capture sort order and the drill depth of a visual because the query is impacted.

MS Data Analyst
Margins include the border area, or edge, around each page. Having a consistently spaced border area frames the report objects.

Because there isn't a report page property to set margins, it's up to you to lay out objects in way that results in a consistent border area. Margin sizes should be equal on the left and right, with possible variation on the top and bottom. Space across the top or bottom can show branding, titles, slicers, or other information that needs to be separated from the visuals.

The quickest way to enforce consistency is to use a report theme. A report theme applies format settings to your entire report, ensuring consistent application of colors, fonts, pages, and visual format options, including the Filters pane styles.





69
MS Data Analyst
Consistency should apply to everything in your report design, including spacing, margins, size, alignment, and especially to object format options. Format options include the selection of font, font size, font weight, colors, and many other styling options. Format options also include the enabling of visual features like axis labels and data labels.

Paginated reports give a pixel-perfect view of the data. Pixel perfect means that you have total control of how the report renders. If you want a footer on every sales receipt that you create, a paginated report is the appropriate solution. If you want a certain customer's name to always appear in green font on a report, you can do that in a paginated report.





71
MS Data Analyst
If the Forecast section isn't available for a line chart, it’s probably because the visual hasn’t been correctly configured. Forecasting is only available when two conditions are met: the axis has a single field of type date, and there’s only one value field.





72

Buttons need to be clearly interactive. If a button doesn't appear to be interactive, the report consumer might not notice it. To help in their discovery, you can apply two formatting options: on-hover formatting and descriptive tooltips.





73
MS Data Analyst
Make sure that you include bookmark requirements in all design decisions. For optimal experiences, you should create bookmarks at the end of report development after you have added all report elements. This approach will help you avoid the complex and time-consuming updating of bookmarks when you're adding new elements.





74

Getting data in a Power BI paginated report does not involve data cleaning steps. In fact, data is not stored in a Power BI paginated report dataset. When data is refreshed on the report, it is retrieved in an unaltered form from the data source, according to the query that was used to retrieve it.





76
MS Data Analyst
For mobile reports, slicers should be vertical, horizontal, or responsive (responsive slicers must be horizontal). If you make the slicer responsive, as you change its size and shape, it shows more or fewer options. If you make the slicer small enough, it becomes a filter icon on the report page.

Visual headers might appear in the upper or lower part of the object. Power BI attempts to show visual headers in the upper right of the object if sufficient space is available between the upper part of the object and the edge of the page. If no space is available in the upper part, Power BI will place the visual headers in the lower-right corner of the visual.





82

Unlike report and page-level filters, a visual-level filter can filter by using a measure. When a measure filters a visual, it's used to eliminate groups. For example, consider a column chart visual that groups by store. A measure filter could eliminate groups (stores) where the total store sales are less than a certain amount.





85
MS Data Analyst
When filters aren't locked, report consumers can modify them. Specifically, they can:

	• Select the eraser icon to clear the filter
	• Apply a new filter selection
	• Change the filter type, such as from basic to advanced (unless disabled for the report).
	• Use the search box to search for values to filter by (unless disabled for the report).

An app is a published, read-only window into your data for mass distribution and viewing. When ready to share apps with your users, you can publish the app. This process requires a Power BI Pro license. Consuming and viewing the app also requires a Pro license, or the workspace must be hosted in a premium capacity.





87
MS Data Analyst
report consumers can't do the following to the report they are reading:

	• Add new filters
	• Remove filters
	• Change the filter type to Top N, or relative date or time (for date/time fields)
  Enforce or disable single selection

The process of identifying outliers involves segmenting your data into two groups: one group is the outlier data and the other group is not. You could use calculated columns to identify outliers, but the results would be static until you refresh the data. A better way to identify outliers is to use a visualization or DAX formula because these methods will ensure that your results are dynamic.





89
MS Data Analyst
Report authors can configure report or visual settings to control filter options and behavior. With report options, you can:

Hide the Filter icon for a specific visual.
Restrict report consumers from changing filter types (for example, basic to advanced) in the Filters pane
Remove the search  box in the Filters pane.





90
MS Data Analyst
You can hide pages when they're not yet ready for use; they're a work in progress. However, you might commonly hide them because you want to control how they're accessed. You can provide report page navigation with buttons or by drilling through from a visual. It's also possible to design a page as a tooltip, which is revealed when a report consumer hovers over a visual.





91
MS Data Analyst
Use the Paginated report visual to embed a Power BI paginated report in your report. Paginated reports can connect directly to source databases, providing you with the ability to present transaction-level detail that's not stored in the Power BI semantic model.

Report settings can:

Add an Apply button to all basic filters in the Filters pane. A single filter will apply when the report consumer selects the Apply button in the filter card.
Add an Apply button to the Filters pane. All filters will apply simultaneously when the report consumer selects the Apply button. This option is helpful when report consumers want to update many filters at the same time.





94

It might be tempting to think that slicers apply page-level filters because that's the default result. However, it's important to understand that a slicer is a visual that propagates filters to other visuals on the same page or (when synced) across other pages.





95
MS Data Analyst
Structurally, a Power BI report connects to a single semantic model (semantic model), and it has at least one report page. However, it's common that reports have multiple pages. On each page, report objects are laid out. Report objects include:

Visuals - Visualizations of semantic model data.

Elements - Provide visual interest but don't use semantic model data. Elements include text boxes, buttons, shapes, and images.





96

When you're ready to deliver your report, it might be helpful to provide a demonstration (or video) to show how you intend report consumers to use the report. That approach will allow you to show how to apply filters and provide lessons on how to apply interactive filtering actions, such as include/exclude groups, cross filtering, report page drillthrough, and bookmarks.

When you create visuals, Power BI Desktop aggregates your data into groups, based on the values that it finds in the underlying data. You can refine how those default groups are presented. You can also create new groups by grouping two or more data points in a visual or putting values into equal-sized groups (binning).

Another important consideration when you are laying out report objects is balance. Balance is concerned with stability and structure in design. In the context of a report layout, balance refers to the weight that is distributed across the report page by the placement of objects of the same or different sizes.

You can’t mix RLS and OLS in the same role. If you need to apply RLS and OLS in the same model, create separate roles dedicated to each type. Also, you can’t set table-level security if it breaks a relationship chain. For example, if there are relationships between tables A and B, and B and C, you can't secure table B.

To create the group, use Ctrl + click to select the data points on the visual that you want to group. For example, the states with sales greater than 500,000 dollars. Right-click one of those selected data points and then select the Group data option. When the group is created, notice that the visual updates to take into account the new group. The following image shows that the other states, which are the states with lower sales (less than 500,000 dollars) have been grouped together and are highlighted in a different shade.

Report settings can:

Disable cross highlighting/filtering by default. All visuals, except for slicers, don't propagate filters to other visuals unless they are explicitly added as a visual interaction.
Add an Apply button to slicers. The slicer selection will only filter the report page when the report consumer selects the Apply button.

When a requirement is in place to lay out many slicers, consider creating a page that is dedicated to showing all slicers. For example, the page could be named Slicers. Sync the slicers to other pages and then set the slicers as hidden on those pages. This design technique will require that report consumers should always go to the Slicers page to modify slicer settings.

On-hover formatting
You can configure buttons to change their state when a hover over is available. When the report consumer hovers the cursor over a button, the cursor icon changes to a pointing finger, which indicates that the button is selectable.

The Relative date and Relative time filter types apply to date fields only, making it possible to filter by relative date or time. Relative filters allow the report consumer to filter by past, present, or future time periods based on the current date and time.





161
MS Data Analyst
Occasionally, report consumers want to know (or verify) what filters, if any, apply to a specific visual. They can complete that action by hovering the cursor over the Filter icon in the visual header. A pop-up window will appear, describing the filters that affect the visual. The pop-up window shows the accumulation of filters that are applied by slicers or filters, including any cross filters.

The Current page state of a bookmark determines whether the bookmark will direct the report consumer to the bookmarked page or apply the current page. Disabling the Current page state is rare, but you should consider some creative use cases. For example, on a page tooltip, a bookmark can change the visuals without navigating from the page that the report consumer has selected.





163
MS Data Analyst
The Display state of a bookmark is related to the visibility of a report object. Objects consist of visuals and also elements like text boxes, buttons, shapes, and images. By using the Selection pane, you can hide or unhide objects and groups of objects. Additionally, you can swap visuals on a report page by creating bookmarks that capture hidden and unhidden objects.

Occasionally, it might make sense to have a single report with many pages. Other times, it could make sense to separate pages into different reports. This scenario is especially true when you design those pages for a different audience or when you need to secure, share, or distribute them differently. Reports are a security and publication unit, and report pages belong to reports and can't be secured or published independently of the report.

The report theme should express your organizational branding or aim to complement it. At a minimum, the theme should include the following elements:

A brand mark or logo symbol.

A palette of colors that align to, or complement, organizational branding. The colors should also be sufficiently different so that, when applied to visuals, they provide appropriate contrast when appearing side by side.

Text settings, including font selection, sizes, and color.

The simplest way to show details is to use drillable visuals. The matrix visual is an excellent choice because it allows drilling on rows and/or columns. Therefore, by assigning hierarchies or multiple fields, report consumers can drill to the level of detail that they want. For example, the matrix rows could show years, and the report consumer could drill down to quarter, month, and date levels.

Another way to use tooltips is to display graphical information. The process of adding this type of tooltip is not as straightforward, but it is worthwhile. You would begin by creating a new page in the report.

Open the new page and then open the Format pane. Expand the Page Size section and then select Tooltip from the Type list.

In the Page information section, turn the Tooltip slider to On so that Power BI registers this page as a tooltip page

Tooltips have limited canvas space, so to ensure that your visuals appear in the tooltip, on the View tab, set the Page view option to Actual size.

Azure Resource groups serve as a scope for applying consistent policies, permissions, and tags to a set of resources. This allows for efficient management of resources based on their lifecycle, ownership, or application within a specific project or environment.





12
Workera.ai
Azure Resources are typically deployed to Azure within the context of a resource group. When a resource group is deleted, all the resources contained within it are also deleted. This simplifies resource lifecycle management, making it easy to create, update, and delete entire environments as a single unit.





13
Workera.ai
Azure Resource Groups leverage Azure's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to assign permissions to users, groups, or applications. This fine-grained access control ensures that only authorized individuals or processes can interact with and modify the resources within a resource group.





14
Workera.ai
When you create a resource group, you need to specify the Azure region in which the resource group will reside. The region you choose determines the geographical location where the metadata for the resource group is stored. Resources within the group can be deployed to the same region or different regions, but the resource group itself has a home region.





15
Workera.ai
Resources within a resource group can be deployed to the same or different regions. However, it's a best practice to deploy resources to the same region within a resource group whenever possible. Placing resources in the same region enhances performance and reduces latency, as they are located closer to each other in the datacenter.

Ezsmdeploy uses the SageMaker Python SDK, which is an open source library for training and deploying machine learning models on Amazon SageMaker. This SDK however focuses on further simplifying deployment from existing models, and as such, this is for you if:

you want to quickly deploy and try out foundational language models as an API powered by SageMaker (New in v 2.0)
you have a serialized model (a pickle / joblib/ json/ TF saved model/ Pytorch .pth/ etc) file and you want to deploy and test your model as an API endpoint
you have a model or multiple models stored as local files, in local folders, or in S3 as tar files (model.tar.gz)

On the Report performance tab of a Report usage metric report, you can view metrics such as:

Typical opening time - How long it takes, at the fiftieth percentile, to open the report.
Opening time trend - How the typical opening time changes over time. This metric can tell you how the report is performing as the number of users starts to grow.
Daily/7-Day Performance charts - Highlight the performance for 10, 50, and 90 percent of the open-report actions every day and over a seven-day period.
Filters for date, so you can see how the performance changes according to the day.

As enterprises grow, so does their data. Often, strict requirements and regulations must be applied to ensure that this sensitive data is secure. Power BI provides a few different ways to help you accomplish this task:

Use Microsoft sensitivity labels to label dashboards, reports, semantic models, and dataflows by using the same taxonomy that is used to classify and protect files in Microsoft 365.
Add more protection measures such as encryption and watermarks when you are exporting the data.
Use Microsoft Cloud App Security to monitor and investigate activities in Power BI.






12
MS Data Analyst
Sensitivity labels specify which data can be exported. These labels are configured externally to Power BI, and Power BI allows you to quickly use them in your reports and dashboards. These labels allow you to define and protect content, even outside of Power BI. semantic models, dataflows, reports, and dashboards can use this mechanism, and all users in your corporation can use this feature unless exceptions have been defined.

Gateway software acts like a bridge; it allows organizations to retain databases and other data sources on their on-premises networks and access that on-premises data in cloud services, such as Power BI and Microsoft Azure Analysis Services.

A gateway facilitates quick, behind-the-scenes communication that flows from a user in the cloud to your on-premises data source and then back again to the cloud.






15
MS Data Analyst
Two types of on-premises gateways are:

Organization mode - Allows multiple users to connect to multiple on-premises data sources and is suitable for complex scenarios.
Personal mode

MS Data Analyst
Two types of on-premises gateways are:

Organization mode 
Personal mode - Allows one user to connect to data sources. This type of gateway can be used only with Power BI and it can't be shared with other users, so it is suitable in situations where you're the only one in your organization who creates reports. You will install the gateway on your local computer, which needs to stay online for the gateway to work.

While you can set a time for the refresh, be aware that the refresh might not take place at that exact time. Power BI starts scheduled refreshes on a best effort basis. The goal is to initiate the refresh within 15 minutes of the scheduled time slot, but a delay of up to one hour can occur if the service can't allocate the required resources sooner.






19
MS Data Analyst
Power BI deactivates your refresh schedule after four consecutive failures or when the service detects an unrecoverable error that requires a configuration update, such as invalid or expired credentials. It is not possible to change the consecutive failures threshold.

MS Data Analyst
Incremental refresh should only be used on data sources and queries that support query folding. If query folding isn't supported, incremental refresh could lead to a bad user experience because, while it will still issue the queries for the relevant partitions, it will pull all data, potentially multiple times.

Power BI provides two ways to endorse your semantic models:

Promotion - Promote your semantic models when they're ready for broad usage.
Certification - Request certification for a promoted semantic model. Certification can be a highly selective process, so only the truly reliable and authoritative semantic models are used across the organization.

With the Query Caching feature, you can use the local caching services of Power BI to process query results. Instead of relying on the semantic model to calculate queries, you use cloud resources on your Premium capacities in the Power BI service to load your report. Query caching ensures constant performance instead of overloading the semantic model resources. Query Caching requires a Premium Capacity.






3
MS Data Analyst
What is the difference between Promotion and Certification when you are endorsing a semantic model? 
Promotion does not need specific permissions while Certification requires permission from the semantic model owner to access to the semantic model.
