 What can you do to improve performance when you're getting data in Power BI? 

Remove unnecessary columns and rows
Correct. Always use the least amount of data needed for your project.

MS Data Analyst
Choose the composite model framework to:

  Boost the query performance of a DirectQuery model.
  Deliver near real-time query results from an import model.
  Extend a Power BI dataset (or AAS model) with additional data.

Microsoft Data Analyst
You develop a Power BI model in Power BI Desktop, and once published to a workspace in the Power BI service, it’s then known as a dataset. A dataset is a Power BI artifact that’s a source of data for visualizations in Power BI reports and dashboards.

2. If you have two queries that have different data but the same column headers, and you want to combine both tables into one query with all the combined rows, which operation should you perform? 

Append
  Correct. Append will take two tables and combine it into one query. The combined query will have more rows while keeping the same number of columns.
Merge
Combine Column

Power BI imposes limits on how often scheduled refresh operations can occur. It’s up to eight times per day in a shared capacity, and up to 48 times per day in a dedicated capacity.





23
MS Data Analyst
When you set up an import table with incremental refresh, you can enable the Get the latest data in real-time with DirectQuery option. By enabling this option, Power BI automatically creates a table partition that uses DirectQuery storage mode. In this case, the table becomes a hybrid table, meaning it has import partitions to store older data, and a single DirectQuery partition for current data. This is a Premium feature.

Geoffrey is a data modeler at Adventure Works who developed a DirectQuery model that connects to the data warehouse. To improve the query performance of higher-grain sales queries, Geoffrey added an import aggregation table. What else should Geoffrey do to improve query performance of the higher-grain queries? 


Set related dimension tables to dual storage mode.
Correct. Setting the related dimension tables to dual storage mode will allow Power BI to satisfy higher-grain queries entirely from cache.





25
MS Data Analyst
 In Power BI Desktop, it’s always possible to convert a DirectQuery table to an import table. But it’s not possible to convert an import table to a DirectQuery table.





26
MS Data Analyst
A significant DirectQuery model limitation is that not all Power Query (M) transformations are possible because these queries must translate to native queries that are understood by source systems. So, for example, it’s not possible to use pivot or unpivot transformations.

General
Some organizations use fiscal years for tax purposes. For example, the federal government's fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. This means that when the government passes its annual budget, it is for the upcoming fiscal year, not the upcoming calendar year.

Dataverse lets you securely store and manage data that's used by business applications. Data within Dataverse is stored within a set of tables. A table is a set of rows (formerly referred to as records) and columns (formerly referred to as fields/attributes).





29
Microsoft Data Analyst
Not all datasets originate from models developed in Power BI Desktop. Some datasets represent connections to external-hosted models in AAS or SSAS. Others can represent real-time data structures, including push datasets, streaming datasets, or hybrid datasets. This module is concerned only with models developed in Power BI Desktop.

Power Virtual Agents
To assist in the upgrade experience, at launch, there is a new clone feature that is now available on bots built using Power Virtual Agents (classic).
This feature will clone the selected Power Virtual Agents classic bot and create a new bot that uses the latest unified authoring version

Microsoft Data Analyst
Power BI imposes dataset size restrictions, which limit the size of a model. When you publish the model to a shared capacity, there’s a 1-GB limit per dataset. When this size limit is exceeded, the dataset will fail to refresh.





32
Power Virtual Agents
In Power Virtual Agents unified authoring release, you can now send an entire Object, whether that be a Dataverse record or a collection of Dataverse records, to send back using the text output of the Power Virtual Agents return statement.

In an Analytic Query, Summarizing produces a single value result. Typically, numeric columns are summarized by using summarization methods (sum, count, and many others). More complex summarizations, like a percent of grand total, can be achieved by defining measures that are written in DAX.





34
MS Data Analyst
Choose the import model framework whenever possible. This framework offers you the most options, design flexibility, and delivers fast performance. Be sure to apply data reduction techniques to ensure that Power BI loads the least amount of data possible.





35
Microsoft Data Analyst
In an Analytic Query, filtering, or slicing, targets the data of relevance. In Power BI reports, filters can be applied to three different scopes: the entire report, a specific page, or a specific visual. Filtering is also applied in the background when row-level security (RLS) is enforced.

Source data tables are mature and ready for immediate use. If you have a table as such, bring it into your data model and don't use any other methods that are outlined in this section. We recommend that you use a source date table because it is likely shared with other tools that you might be using in addition to Power BI.

To create a date table in Power Query:

  New Query > Blank Query
  = List.Dates(#date(2011,05,31), 365*10, #duration(1,0,0,0))
    Makes a list of dates starting May 31, 2011, 1 day increment, ~10 years
  Transform > Convert > To Table
  Convert datatype of column to Date
  Create additional columns for hierarchy

Normalization vs. denormalization: Normalization is the term used to describe data that’s stored in a way that reduces repetitious data. In contrast, denormalization refers to storing product details beyond the key in a sales table. Star schemas are typically denormalized to improve performance and ensure accurate results.

Creating a hierarchy in Power BI is straightforward. You can right-click on the field you want to set as level 1 of the hierarchy in the fields list and select "Create Hierarchy". You can then add additional levels to the hierarchy by dragging and dropping or using the “Add to hierarchy” option




8
MS Data Analyst
A Power BI hierarchy is a collection of related fields within a dataset, arranged in a way that displays one element ranked over the other fields. It is a useful structure for drill-down and data exploration in reports.




9
MS Data Analyst
A hierarchy consists of multiple levels, where one level is the parent of another level. For example, a category, subcategory, and product can form a hierarchy. There is no limit on the number of levels; it can be one or more than ten levels.




10
MS Data Analyst
You can use the PATH() function to return a string which contains a delimited list of IDs, starting with the top/root of a hierarchy and ending with the specified ID. For example, in an Employees table that contains employees, their managers, and their managers’ managers, you can return the path that connects an employee to his or her manager.




11
MS Data Analyst
The PATH() function is used to convert a parent-child relationship in a delimited text format. The syntax of the PATH() function is 

  PATH(<ID_columnName>, <parent_columnName>).
