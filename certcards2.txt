HTTP request concept:
OAuth: This is an open standard for authorization that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their credentials. The user is redirected to the authorization server, where they grant access to the third-party application. The application then receives an access token, which is used to authenticate requests to the resource server.

Margins include the border area, or edge, around each page. Having a consistently spaced border area frames the report objects.

Because there isn't a report page property to set margins, it's up to you to lay out objects in way that results in a consistent border area. Margin sizes should be equal on the left and right, with possible variation on the top and bottom. Space across the top or bottom can show branding, titles, slicers, or other information that needs to be separated from the visuals.

Sometimes, a copilot user asks a question that has no built topic. By default, the copilot prompts the user to rephrase their query. After two prompts, if the copilot still can't determine the user's intent, the copilot escalates to a live agent through the system Escalate topic.

The Boost conversations option in Copilot Studio helps solve that issue by using the natural language processing capabilities of Azure OpenAI. OpenAI's GPT technology with the AI already in Copilot Studio include transformer-based natural language understanding that helps the copilot to:

Understand a user's intent by parsing what they type and determining what they're asking.
Find, collate, and parse relevant information from a URL you specify.
Create a plain language response for the copilot user.

When a copilot can't find a matching intent (topic) for the user's query, it uses generative answers and tries to answer a question. This behavior is called "Generative Answers for fallback." If the user's intent isn't matched to topics or generative answers, the fallback system topic is used. System topics can escalate a query for the copilot.

Generative answers can use these sources:

External resources:
Bing Web Search—doesn't require external configuration
Bing Custom Search—requires external configuration




5
Microsoft Copilot Studio
Generative answers can use these sources:

Internal resources:
SharePoint (.aspx pages aren't supported)
OneDrive for Business
Documents uploaded to Dataverse
Custom data (internal or external): supply your own source, such as a Power Automate Flow or from Skill.

The URL used in your copilot represents the scope of content for generating responses. There are requirements and restrictions on some URLs.

If the URL provided redirects to another top-level site, the content isn't included in results:

For example, if www.fabrikam.com redirects to www.contoso.fabrikam.com, your copilot doesn't generate responses from content on either of those URLs.

The URL used in your copilot represents the scope of content for generating responses. There are requirements and restrictions on some URLs.

URLs that point to a website, requiring authentication or ones not indexed by Bing.

For example, wikis and SharePoint sites require authentication, therefore can't be used:

fabrikam.visualstudio.com/project/_wiki
fabrikam.sharepoint.com

Your copilot has difficulty answering questions that require calculations, comparisons, or form submissions. Your copilot might not understand comparative and superlative terms such as better or best, latest, or cheapest in a question.

Microsoft Copilot Studio
Within a copilot's topic, you can add a Create generative answers node. This node allows you to specify more sources that the node searches based on your inputs. Information sources defined in the Generative answers node override sources you specified at the copilot level, which functions as a fallback.

GraphSearch in Azure is a service that allows users to query and analyze large-scale graph data. It enables users to discover connections and relationships within complex datasets, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs.






11
Microsoft Copilot Studio
GraphSearch is designed to integrate seamlessly with other Azure services, allowing users to leverage the full capabilities of the Azure ecosystem. This includes integration with Azure Active Directory for authentication and access control, Azure Data Lake Storage for storing large volumes of graph data, and Azure Synapse Analytics for advanced analytics and data processing.






12
Microsoft Copilot Studio
GraphSearch is built to scale horizontally, allowing users to handle large volumes of graph data and queries efficiently. It leverages distributed computing and storage to achieve high performance, enabling users to process complex graph queries in real-time or near real-time.

Microsoft Copilot Studio
Some sources require authentication, since the copilot makes calls on behalf of the user in the chat window. Calls use the account credentials from powerva.microsoft.com. The authentication settings configured in the copilot need manual authentication with the Service Provider type of Microsoft Entra ID.

Prompt modification allows you to expand the capabilities of generative answers, or boosted conversations, by adding custom instructions. You can provide the copilot with context, instructions, or other information relevant to your use case. This is the system message that can be included at the start of a conversation with a generative AI model.




15
Microsoft Copilot Studio
You can upload your own documents for your copilot to generate answers with generative AI. The documents are used across your copilot, but you can specify individual nodes that shouldn't use uploaded documents. Uploaded documents are stored securely in Dataverse. The number of documents you can upload is only limited by the available file storage for your Dataverse environment.

Microsoft Copilot Studio
Due to memory limits, generative answers can only use SharePoint files that are under 3 MB. If a file is larger than 3 MB, consider splitting it into multiple smaller files.




17
Microsoft Copilot Studio
Use content on SharePoint or OneDrive for Business for generative answers works by pairing your copilot with a URL, such as contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/policies. When a copilot user asks a question and the copilot doesn't have a topic to use for an answer, the copilot searches the URL and all sub-paths. For example, a URL such as contoso.sharepoint.com/sites also includes subpaths like contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/policies. 




18
Microsoft Copilot Studio
When using SharePoint or OneDrive as a datasource, a best practice is to omit https:// from the URL. Recognized SharePoint URLs will be from the sharepoint.com domain.
Sharepoint site URLs cannot be more than two levels deep.
Content from aspx files on SharePoint won't be used to generate answers.

ASPX Pages: ASPX (Active Server Pages Extended) is the primary technology used in SharePoint for creating web pages. ASPX pages in SharePoint are essentially web pages with dynamic content generated by server-side scripts.




20
Microsoft Copilot Studio
SharePoint uses ASPX pages for its master pages and page layouts. Master pages define the overall look and feel of a SharePoint site, including its branding, navigation, and page structure. Page layouts, on the other hand, define the layout and content structure of individual pages within a site.

Often, you use re.search() to search for a particular pattern inside a string. This function is somewhat more complicated than re.findall() because it returns an object called MatchObject that stores different groups of data. This is because there might be matches inside other matches, and re.search() returns every possible result.

There’s one more function in the re module that’s useful for parsing out text. re.sub(), which is short for substitute, allows you to replace the text in a string that matches a regular expression with new text. It behaves sort of like the .replace() string method.

Site Scraping
>>> string = "Everything is <replaced> if it's in <tags>."
>>> string = re.sub("<.*>", "ELEPHANTS", string)
>>> string
'Everything is ELEPHANTS.'
re.sub() uses the regular expression "<.*>" to find and replace everything between the first < and the last >, which spans from the beginning of <replaced> to the end of <tags>. This is because Python’s regular expressions are greedy, meaning they try to find the longest possible match when characters like * are used.

>>> soup.find_all("img")
[<img src="/static/dionysus.jpg"/>, <img src="/static/grapes.png"/>]
This returns a list of all <img> tags in the HTML document parsed by the beautifulsoup object soup. The objects in the list look like they might be strings representing the tags, but they’re actually instances of the Tag object provided by Beautiful Soup. Tag objects provide a simple interface for working with the information they contain.




5
Site Scraping
One of the features of Beautiful Soup is the ability to search for specific kinds of tags whose attributes match certain values. For example, if you want to find all the <img> tags that have a src attribute equal to the value /static/dionysus.jpg, then you can provide the following additional argument to .find_all():

>>> soup.find_all("img", src="/static/dionysus.jpg")
[<img src="/static/dionysus.jpg"/>]

Asynchronous: AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, allows web pages to send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously, without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. This means that the user can continue to interact with the page while data is being exchanged in the background.

Site Scraping
Dynamic content: AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, techniques can be used to dynamically update the content of a web page without requiring a full page refresh. This can improve the user experience by providing faster and more seamless updates.
