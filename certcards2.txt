Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Enter the following code to start the sample app. The -d flag is to run it as a background, non-interactive app. The -p flag is to map port 8080 in the container that's created to port 8080 locally. This setting is intended to avoid conflicts with any web apps already running on your computer. The command will respond with a lengthy hexadecimal identifier for the instance.

Bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/samples:aspnetapp





14
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
To place a container in the run state, use the run command. You can also restart a container that's already running. When restarting a container, the container receives a termination signal to enable any running processes to shut down gracefully before the container's kernel terminates.





15
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
You can remove an image from the local computer with the docker image rm command. Specify the image ID of the image to remove. The following example removes the image for the sample web app.

Bash

Container storage drives are less performant.

Containers implement a storage driver to allow your apps to write data. This driver introduces an extra abstraction to communicate with the host OS kernel, and is less performant than writing directly to a host filesystem.

Containers can make use of two options to persist data. The first option is to make use of volumes, and the second is bind mounts.





18
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
For more advanced scenarios, both Linux and Windows provide additional network options. For example, the overlay option creates a virtual switch from the host network, so containers on that network can get IP addresses from DHCP servers or operate with IP addresses from that network segment. Furthermore, Docker allows third-party vendors to create network plugins.





19
OData
Inheritance Hierarchies allow entities to derive properties and behaviors from parent entities, enabling reuse and polymorphism. Managed in Dataverse using OData's @odata.type, they allow clients to interact with a hierarchy of related entity types effectively.





20
OData
Complex Types are structured data types in OData that group multiple related properties into a single reusable structure. They allow for more organized and modular data models by encapsulating related data, such as addresses or contact information.





21
OData
Formatting Instructions are guidelines that specify how data should be presented or displayed. Defined using annotations, they help client applications render data appropriately, such as formatting dates, numbers, or currencies in a user-friendly manner.





22
OData
Delta Queries allow clients to track changes (additions, deletions, updates) and synchronize data efficiently without retrieving the entire dataset each time. This feature optimizes performance and reduces bandwidth usage by enabling incremental data synchronization.





23
OData
ETags

Definition: Entity tags (ETags) are version identifiers for a resource, used in OData (and HTTP in general) to support concurrency and caching.
Context: When a client retrieves an entity with an ETag, it can include that ETag in update or delete requests. The server uses this to detect if the entity has changed since it was last read, helping prevent overwriting changes from other clients.





24
OData
$format Query Option

Definition: An OData query parameter that suggests the response format (e.g., JSON or XML) the client prefers.
Context: It does not affect server-internal logging or behavior, only the format of the returned data.





25
Python
In computer programming jargon, a heisenbug is a software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior when one attempts to study it.[1] The term is a pun on the name of Werner Heisenberg, the physicist who first asserted the observer effect of quantum mechanics, which states that the act of observing a system inevitably alters its state.





26
Python
Because the decoding of bytes to a str requires an encoding scheme, Requests will try to guess the encoding based on the response’s headers if you don’t specify one. You can provide an explicit encoding by setting .encoding before accessing .text:

>>> response.encoding = "utf-8"  # Optional: Requests infers this.
>>> response.text
'{"current_user_url":"https://api.github.com/user", ...}'





27
Python
The print() function allows you to control the format of the output using keyword arguments like sep and end.

The sep argument determines how to separate multiple objects, while the end argument specifies what to print at the end of the output instead of the default newline.





28
Python
In Python, special methods support comparison operators.

For example, the .__lt__() method supports the < operator, .__gt__() supports >, and the .__eq__() method supports the == operator.

These methods allow you to define custom behavior for comparison operations in your custom classes.





29
Python
On UNIX-like systems, readline is part of Python’s standard library, so you don’t need to install anything. On modern Windows versions, you don’t even need to work with readline because these advanced editing capabilities are already built into the console natively.





30
Python
If you invoke Response.raise_for_status(), then Requests will raise an HTTPError for status codes between 400 and 600. If the status code indicates a successful request, then the program will proceed without raising that exception.

The .__iter__() special method initializes the iterator and must return an iterator object, typically self.

The .__next__() method retrieves the next value in the data stream and must raise a StopIteration exception when the data stream is exhausted.





31
Azure Functions
By default, functions have a timeout of five (5) minutes. This timeout is configurable to a maximum of 10 minutes. If your function requires more than 10 minutes to execute, you can host it on a VM. Additionally, if your service is initiated through an HTTP request and you expect that value as an HTTP response, the timeout is further restricted to 2.5 minutes.





32
Azure Functions
Human interaction: This pattern combines automated processes that also involve some human interaction. A manual process within an automated process is tricky because people aren't as highly available and as responsive as most computers. You can incorporate human interaction using timeouts and compensation logic that runs if the human fails to interact correctly within a specified response time.





33
Azure Functions
Durable Functions allows you to define stateful workflows using an orchestration function. An orchestration function provides these extra benefits:
You can define the workflows in code. You don't need to write a JSON description or use a workflow design tool.
Functions can be called both synchronously and asynchronously. Output from the called functions is saved locally in variables and used in subsequent function calls.





34
Azure Functions
Async HTTP APIs: This pattern addresses the problem of coordinating state of long-running operations with external clients. An HTTP call can trigger the long-running action, then redirect the client to a status endpoint. The client can learn when the operation is finished by polling this endpoint.





35
Azure Functions
2. Which of the following best describes the role of the Orchestrator function in a workflow? 
The Orchestrator Function is written in code. The function is used for describing how actions are executed and the order in which actions are executed.





36
Azure Functions
Monitor: This pattern implements a recurring process in a workflow, possibly looking for a change in state. For example, you could use this pattern to poll until specific conditions are met.

MS Identity Platform
Authorization server - The Microsoft identity platform is the authorization server. Also called an identity provider or IdP, it securely handles the end-user's information, their access, and the trust relationships between the parties in the auth flow. The authorization server issues the security tokens your apps and APIs use for granting, denying, or revoking access to resources (authorization) after the user has signed in (authenticated).





121
MS Identity Platform
Resource owner - The resource owner in an auth flow is usually the application user, or end-user in OAuth terminology. The end-user "owns" the protected resource (their data) which your app accesses on their behalf. The resources owners can grant or deny your app (the client) access to the resources they own. For example, your app might call an external system's API to get a user's email address from their profile on that system.





122
MS Identity Platform
Client - The client in an OAuth exchange is the application requesting access to a protected resource. The client could be a web app running on a server, a single-page web app running in a user's web browser, or a web API that calls another web API. You'll often see the client referred to as client application, application, or app.





123
MS Identity Platform
Confidential client applications: Apps in this category include:

Web apps that call a web API
Web APIs that call a web API
Daemon apps, even when implemented as a console service like a Linux daemon or a Windows service





124
MS Identity Platform
The parties in an authentication flow use bearer tokens to assure, verify, and authenticate a principal (user, host, or service) and to grant or deny access to protected resources (authorization). Bearer tokens in the Microsoft identity platform are formatted as JSON Web Tokens (JWT).





125
MS Identity Platform
If your desktop or mobile application runs on Windows and on a machine connected to a Windows domain (Active Directory or Microsoft Entra joined) it is possible to use the Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) to acquire a token silently. No UI is required when using the application.

Azure AI Search
Indexers drive skillset execution and AI enrichment, where you can configure skills to integrate extra processing of content en route to an index. A few examples are OCR over image files, text split skill for data chunking, and calling embedding models to generate vectors for vector search.





149
Azure AI Search
A search service runs one indexer job per search unit. If you need concurrent processing, make sure you have sufficient replicas. Indexers don't run in the background, so you might detect more query throttling than usual if the service is under pressure.





150
Azure AI Search
You can run indexers on demand or on a recurring data refresh schedule that runs as often as every five minutes. More frequent updates preclude the use of indexers, requiring that you implement a 'push model' that simultaneously pushes data to both Azure AI Search and your external data source.





151
Azure AI Search
Push model is an approach that uses APIs to upload documents into an existing search index. You can upload documents in batches of up to 1000 per batch, or 16 MB per batch, whichever limit comes first.





152
Azure AI Search
You can have multiple indexers writing into the same index, and you can reuse the same data source for multiple indexers. However, an indexer can only consume one data source at a time, and can only write to a single index.





153
Diffusers Library
There are three main components of the library to know about:
Many different schedulers - algorithms that control how noise is added for training, and how to generate denoised images during inference.





154
Diffusers Library
Markov Chain
A sequence of random variables where each state depends only on the previous one. In diffusion models, the noise addition process is modeled as a Markov chain, allowing controlled transitions from clear images to noisy ones and vice versa, simplifying the math for training.





155
Diffusers Library
Denoising Process
The step-by-step refinement in diffusion models where the model removes noise from a random input, progressing towards an image. At each step, the model estimates the noise in the image and subtracts it, gradually enhancing coherence and detail.





156
Diffusers Library
Classifier-Free Guidance
A technique allowing diffusion models to generate images without an external classifier, enhancing flexibility in output. This guidance uses the model's own internal structure to fine-tune the output, improving realism without the need for additional label constraints.





157
Diffusers Library
Forward and Reverse Processes
In diffusion, the forward process gradually adds noise to data, following a fixed probabilistic schedule, and the reverse process learns to denoise the noisy data. Mathematically, the forward process models q(x_t | x_{t-1}), while the reverse learns p(x_{t-1} | x_t) to reconstruct images.





158
Diffusers Library
Reverse Diffusion
The inverse process where an image is generated by removing noise, step-by-step, from an initial noisy state. This approach is essential in diffusion models, reconstructing data by "reversing" the diffusion process and achieving high-quality image outputs.

PEP 8
Spaces Around Binary Operators: Place one space on both sides of binary operators (e.g., =, +, -, ==). This spacing makes expressions clearer and easier to read. For example:

python
total = price + tax





348
PEP 8
Handle Import Errors Gracefully: When dealing with optional dependencies, use try-except blocks to handle ImportError exceptions. This prevents the entire application from crashing if an optional module isn't available, allowing for more robust and flexible code.





349
PEP 8
Use Parentheses for Multi-Line Imports: When importing multiple objects from a module, enclose them within parentheses and list each on a separate line. This enhances readability and adheres to line length restrictions without using backslashes.





350
PEP 8
Prevent Circular Imports: Avoid scenarios where two modules depend on each other directly or indirectly. Refactor by combining modules, extracting common functionality, or using local imports within functions to defer the import until necessary.





351

Data chunking during indexing
Text-to-vector conversion during indexing
Text-to-vector conversion during queries





372
Azure AI Search
Indexers don't have dedicated processing resources. Based on this, indexers' status may show as idle before running (depending on other jobs in the queue) and run times may not be predictable. Other factors define indexer performance as well, such as document size, document complexity, image analysis, among others.





373
Search Engine Optimization
Duplicate content refers to identical or very similar content appearing on multiple webpages or across different websites. It can negatively impact SEO by causing confusion for search engines about which page to rank, potentially diluting search rankings.

Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A volume is stored on the host filesystem at a specific folder location. Choose a folder where you know the data won't be modified by non-Docker processes.

Docker creates and manages the new volume by running the docker volume create command. This command can form part of our Dockerfile definition, which means that you can create volumes as part of the container-creation process. Docker creates the volume if it doesn't exist when you try to mount the volume into a container the first time.





376
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
To pause a running container, use the pause command. This command suspends all processes in the container.

To stop a running container, use the stop command. The stop command enables the working process to shut down gracefully by sending it a termination signal. The container's kernel terminates after the process shuts down.





377
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Azure Container Registry repositories are private, meaning they don't support unauthenticated access. To pull images from an Azure Container Registry repository, use the docker login command and specify the URL of the login server for the registry.

docker login myregistry.azurecr.io





378
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
The following example creates an alias for the reservationsystem image.

Bash
docker tag reservationsystem myregistry.azurecr.io/reservationsystem:v2

If you run docker image ls, you'll see two entries for the image: one with the original name and the second with the new alias.





379
OData
While not directly related to OData or Dataverse, yield is a programming concept used in iterators to return values one at a time. It is useful in broader API interactions and data processing but is not a primary term in the OData/Dataverse context.





380
OData
Metadata in OData describes the structure, data types, relationships, and other aspects of the data model. The $metadata endpoint provides the service’s data model and schema definitions using CSDL, essential for understanding available entities and their relationships.





381
OData
$compute Query Option

Definition: An OData query option that lets you add computed properties to the result on the fly, based on existing fields.
Context: For example, $compute=TotalPrice mul Quantity as ExtendedAmount could create a new ExtendedAmount field without altering the underlying data model.





382
OData
Delta Links

Definition: Special links returned by the server that allow clients to track incremental changes rather than retrieving the entire dataset repeatedly.
Context: After an initial full read, a client can use a delta link to get only the new or changed data. This is useful for synchronization scenarios and efficient data updates.





383
OData
Namespaces

Definition: Unique identifiers (like MyCompany.CRM) that group related schemas and prevent naming conflicts in OData models.
Context: Used to differentiate entities, actions, and functions that may share common names but serve different domains or versions.





384
OData
A Delta Token is a marker used in Delta Queries to track changes since the last query. Clients use delta tokens to request only the changes (additions, deletions, updates) that have occurred since their last synchronization, optimizing data retrieval.





385
Azure Functions
There are two types of managed identities:

System-assigned. Some Azure resources, such as virtual machines allow you to enable a managed identity directly on the resource.
User-assigned. You may also create a managed identity as a standalone Azure resource. You can create a user-assigned managed identity and assign it to one or more Azure Resources.





386
Azure Functions
When you enable a user-assigned managed identity:

A service principal of a special type is created in Microsoft Entra ID for the identity. The service principal is managed separately from the resources that use it.





387
Azure Functions
The name of the system-assigned service principal is always the same as the name of the Azure resource it's created for. For a deployment slot, the name of its system-assigned identity is <app-name>/slots/<slot-name>.





388
Azure Functions
When you enable a system-assigned managed identity:

A service principal of a special type is created in Microsoft Entra ID for the identity. The service principal is tied to the lifecycle of that Azure resource. When the Azure resource is deleted, Azure automatically deletes the service principal for you.





389
Azure Functions
Here are some of the benefits of using managed identities:

You don't need to manage credentials. Credentials aren’t even accessible to you.
You can use managed identities to authenticate to any resource that supports Microsoft Entra authentication, including your own applications.
Managed identities can be used at no extra cost.

PEP 8
Spaces Around Assignment Operators: Use spaces around assignment operators (=) to differentiate them from keyword arguments and enhance clarity in variable assignments.

python
Copy code
total = 100





435
PEP 8
Spaces Before Opening Parentheses: Do not add a space before the opening parenthesis in function calls, definitions, or other uses. This rule keeps the syntax clean and consistent.

python
Copy code
my_function(arg1, arg2)





436
PEP 8
One Import Per Line: Place each import statement on its own line to improve clarity and simplify version control diffs. Avoid combining multiple imports in a single line, which can make the code harder to read and maintain.





437
PEP 8
Breaking Long Lines with Parentheses: Use parentheses to implicitly continue lines instead of backslashes. This method is more readable and less error-prone. Align continued lines vertically for clarity.

python
Copy code
total = (
    first_variable
    + second_variable
    - third_variable
)





438
PEP 8
Spaces in Slices and Function Parameters: Do not add spaces inside slicing brackets or between function parameters unless necessary for clarity. Proper spacing maintains clean syntax.
