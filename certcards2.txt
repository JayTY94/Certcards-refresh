Python
In Python, you can compare sequences of the same type. When comparing two sequences, the first 
non-equal
 value determines the outcome.

For example, consider the following lists:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
more_numbers = [1, 2, 2, 10, 20]
When you compare these lists, you’ll find that numbers is greater than more_numbers.

Sessions are used to persist parameters across requests. For example, if you want to use the same authentication across multiple requests, then you can use a session:

import requests

TOKEN = "<YOUR_GITHUB_PA_TOKEN>"

with requests.Session() as session:
    session.auth = TokenAuth(TOKEN)

    first_response = session.get("https://api.github.com/user")
    second_response = session.get("https://api.github.com/user")

Front: How does Docker Networking facilitate communication between containers?

Back: Docker Networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with external networks through virtual networks. Docker provides several network drivers (e.g., bridge, host, overlay) that define how containers connect and interact. Custom networks can be created to isolate groups of containers or enable specific communication patterns.





21
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
The Docker Engine consists of several components configured as a client-server implementation where the client and server run simultaneously on the same host. The client communicates with the server using a REST API, which enables the client to also communicate with a remote server instance.





22
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A base image is an image that uses the Docker scratch image. The scratch image is an empty container image that doesn't create a filesystem layer. This image assumes that the application you're going to run can directly use the host OS kernel.





23
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
We use Unionfs to create Docker images. Unionfs is a filesystem that allows you to stack several directories—called branches—in such a way that it appears as if the content is merged. However, the content is physically kept separate. Unionfs allows you to add and remove branches as you build out your file system.





24
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A single image can have multiple tags assigned to it. By convention, the most recent version of an image is assigned the latest tag and a tag that describes the image version number. When you release a new version of an image, you can reassign the latest tag to reference the new image.





25
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
The ENTRYPOINT in the Dockerfileile indicates which process will execute once we run a container from an image. If there's no ENTRYPOINT or another process to be executed, Docker will interpret that as there's nothing for the container to do, and the container will exit.

31
Azure Functions
Just like the other triggers we've seen so far, you can create a blob trigger in the Azure portal. Inside your Azure function, select Blob trigger from the list of predefined trigger types. Then, enter the logic that you want to execute when a blob is created or updated.

One setting that's important to understand is the Path. The Path tells the blob trigger which blob container to monitor to see if a blob is uploaded or updated. By default, the Path value is:

samples-workitems/{name}





32
Azure Functions
A binding expression is specialized text in function.json, function parameters, or code that is evaluated when the function is invoked, to yield a value. For example, if you have a Service Bus Queue binding, you could use a binding expression to obtain the name of the queue from App Settings.





33
Azure Functions
Every Azure Function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to use multiple triggers, you must create multiple functions.





34
Azure Functions
Reasons to choose WebJobs over Azure Functions

38
PP365
Workflow in the context of Microsoft Dataverse and Power Apps refers to the automation of business processes and tasks. Workflows are a series of steps and rules that define how data is processed and managed within the system. Workflows can be triggered by events such as record creation, update, or deletion, and can perform actions like sending emails, updating records, creating tasks, and more.





39
PP365
To support offline use, Power Apps allows data to be cached locally on the device. Users can create, update, and delete records while offline, and these changes are synchronized with the Dataverse database once the device reconnects to the internet. This must all be configured ahead of time.





40
PP365
In most cases, adding users to an environment only gives users access to the environment itself, not to any resources (apps and data) in the environment. You need to configure access to resources by assigning security roles to users.





41
MS Identity Platform
OpenID Connect versus SAML: The platform uses both OpenID Connect and SAML to authenticate a user and enable single sign-on. SAML authentication is commonly used with identity providers such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) federated to Microsoft Entra ID, so it's often used in enterprise applications.





42
MS Identity Platform
URIs for certain apps:
○ Apps that use embedded browsers: https://login.microsoft.com/common/oauth2/nativeclient (Note: if your app would pop up a window which typically contains no address bar, it is using the "embedded browser")
Apps that would use system browsers: http://loclahost (Note: If your app would bring your system's default browser (such as edge, chrome, firefox, and so on) to visit Microsoft login portal, it is using the "system browser".)





43
MS Identity Platform
Authorization server - The Microsoft identity platform is the authorization server. Also called an identity provider or IdP, it securely handles the end-user's information, their access, and the trust relationships between the parties in the auth flow. The authorization server issues the security tokens your apps and APIs use for granting, denying, or revoking access to resources (authorization) after the user has signed in (authenticated).





44
MS Identity Platform
Authentication scenarios involve two activities:

Acquiring security tokens for a protected web API: We recommend that you use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), developed and supported by Microsoft.
Protecting a web API or a web app: One challenge of protecting these resources is validating the security token. On some platforms, Microsoft offers middleware libraries.





45
MS Identity Platform
The parties in an authentication flow use bearer tokens to assure, verify, and authenticate a principal (user, host, or service) and to grant or deny access to protected resources (authorization). Bearer tokens in the Microsoft identity platform are formatted as JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Dataverse Plugins
The Plugin Execution Pipeline defines the sequence of events where plugins can be triggered in Dataverse. The primary stages include:

Pre-validation: Executes before the main system operation, allowing for early validation.
Pre-operation: Runs after the main operation is validated but before it's committed to the database.
Post-operation: Occurs after the main operation has been completed and committed. Understanding these stages is crucial for placing plugins at the appropriate point in the data processing workflow, ensuring optimal performance and data integrity.





97
Dataverse Plugins
Filtering Attributes are specific fields defined during the registration of a plugin that determine when the plugin should execute. For instance, a plugin might be set to trigger only when certain attributes of an entity are updated. By specifying these attributes, Dataverse optimizes performance by invoking the plugin only when relevant data changes occur, rather than on every update to the entity.





98
Dataverse Plugins
API Permissions and Scopes define what operations an application can perform and what data it can access within an API like Dataverse Web API. During Azure AD application registration, permissions are granted (e.g., user_impersonation) to control access levels. Scopes specify the exact permissions requested during the authentication process. Proper configuration ensures that applications have the necessary access without over-privileging, adhering to the principle of least privilege for security.





99
Dataverse Plugins
SDK Message Processing Steps represent the registration details of a plugin within Dataverse. Each step defines when (which message and stage) and how a plugin executes. Key properties include the message (e.g., Update), primary entity, execution pipeline stage (Pre-validation, Pre-operation, Post-operation), and filtering attributes. These steps orchestrate the plugin's behavior in response to data operations.





100
Dataverse Plugins
Plugins are custom business logic components that execute in response to specific events within Dataverse, such as record creation or updates. Written in .NET, plugins can enforce business rules, validate data, or integrate with external systems. They are registered against specific messages (like Create, Update) and entities, allowing for granular control over when and how custom logic is triggered within the Dataverse environment.

123
Python
Authentication helps a service understand who you are. Typically, you provide your credentials to a server by passing data through the Authorization header or a custom header defined by the service. All the functions of Requests that you’ve seen to this point provide a parameter called auth, which allows you to pass your credentials:

>>> import requests

>>> response = requests.get(
...     "https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd",
...     auth=("user", "passwd")
... )





124
Python
The CRUD operations correspond almost one-to-one with SQL commands:

Create: INSERT
Read: SELECT
Update: UPDATE
Delete: DELETE
So, to modify existing data in SQL, you would use the UPDATE command.





125
Python
import re

def replace_punctuations_and_spaces(input_string):
    # Define the pattern to match all punctuations and spaces
    pattern = r'[^\w]'
    # Replace all matched characters with an empty string
    result = re.sub(pattern, '', input_string)
    return result





126
Python
The response headers can give you useful information, such as the content type of the response payload and a time limit on how long to cache the response. To view these headers, access .headers:

>>> import requests

>>> response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
>>> response.headers
{'Server': 'GitHub.com',
...
'X-GitHub-Request-Id': 'AE83:3F40:2151C46:438A840:65C38178'}





127
Python
To create an iterator in Python, you need to implement .__iter__() and .__next__().

The .__iter__() special method initializes the iterator and must return an iterator object, typically self.

The .__next__() method retrieves the next value in the data stream and must raise a StopIteration exception when the data stream is exhausted.

Diffusers Library
Forward and Reverse Processes
In diffusion, the forward process gradually adds noise to data, following a fixed probabilistic schedule, and the reverse process learns to denoise the noisy data. Mathematically, the forward process models q(x_t | x_{t-1}), while the reverse learns p(x_{t-1} | x_t) to reconstruct images.





134
Diffusers Library
ELBO (Evidence Lower Bound)
A loss function that diffusion models optimize to maximize the likelihood of generating realistic data. ELBO breaks down the generative process into manageable steps, penalizing differences between real and generated data distributions, balancing reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.





135
Diffusers Library
Variational Inference

143
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Container storage drives are less performant.

Containers implement a storage driver to allow your apps to write data. This driver introduces an extra abstraction to communicate with the host OS kernel, and is less performant than writing directly to a host filesystem.

Containers can make use of two options to persist data. The first option is to make use of volumes, and the second is bind mounts.





144
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker images are large files that are initially stored on your PC, and we need tools to manage these files.

The Docker CLI and Docker Desktop allow us to manage images by building, listing, removing, and running them. We manage Docker images by using the docker client. The client doesn't execute the commands directly, and sends all queries to the dockerd daemon.





145
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
For more advanced scenarios, both Linux and Windows provide additional network options. For example, the overlay option creates a virtual switch from the host network, so containers on that network can get IP addresses from DHCP servers or operate with IP addresses from that network segment. Furthermore, Docker allows third-party vendors to create network plugins.





146
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A registry is organized as a series of repositories. Each repository contains multiple Docker images that share a common name and generally the same purpose and functionality. These images normally have different versions, identified with a tag. This mechanism enables you to publish and retain multiple versions of images for compatibility reasons.





147
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
The host network enables you to run the container on the host network directly. This configuration effectively removes the isolation between the host and the container at a network level.

Keep in mind that the container can use only ports the host isn't already using.





148

153
Azure Functions
In an blob input binding definition:
      "path": "thumbnail-images/{filename}",
Provide the path, which specifies the container and the item name that goes in it. The path property is required when using the blob trigger, and should be provided in the style shown here, with curly braces around the filename portion of the path. This syntax creates a binding expression that allows you to reference the blob's name in other bindings, and in your function's code.





154
Azure Functions
Three properties are required in all bindings, though you might have to supply more properties based on the type of binding and storage you're using.

Name - Defines the function parameter through which you access the data. For example, in a queue input binding, this property is the name of the function parameter that receives the queue message content.
Type - Identifies the type of binding. For example, the type of data or service you want to interact with.
Direction - Indicates the direction data is flowing. For example, is it an input or output binding?





155
Azure Functions
By default, functions have a timeout of five (5) minutes. This timeout is configurable to a maximum of 10 minutes. If your function requires more than 10 minutes to execute, you can host it on a VM. Additionally, if your service is initiated through an HTTP request and you expect that value as an HTTP response, the timeout is further restricted to 2.5 minutes.

162
PP365
I had a ticket with Lauren Kawamoto going back to 11/22/24 about her permissions in the sandbox. It turns out that she needed the "TS - Recur Engagement" role to recur engagements. I thought that "system administrator" would be enough, but I was not able to do that myself with the sysadmin role. Strange.





163
MS Identity Platform
ID token - ID tokens are sent to the client application as part of an OpenID Connect flow. They can be sent alongside or instead of an access token. ID tokens are used by the client to authenticate the user. To learn more about how the Microsoft identity platform issues ID tokens, see ID tokens in the Microsoft identity platform.





164
MS Identity Platform
OAuth versus OpenID Connect: The platform uses OAuth for authorization and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0, so the terminology and flow are similar between the two. You can even both authenticate a user (through OpenID Connect) and get authorization to access a protected resource that the user owns (through OAuth 2.0) in one request.





165
MS Identity Platform
Client - The client in an OAuth exchange is the application requesting access to a protected resource. The client could be a web app running on a server, a single-page web app running in a user's web browser, or a web API that calls another web API. You'll often see the client referred to as client application, application, or app.





166
MS Identity Platform
If your desktop or mobile application runs on Windows and on a machine connected to a Windows domain (Active Directory or Microsoft Entra joined) it is possible to use the Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) to acquire a token silently. No UI is required when using the application.





167
MS Identity Platform
Resource owner - The resource owner in an auth flow is usually the application user, or end-user in OAuth terminology. The end-user "owns" the protected resource (their data) which your app accesses on their behalf. The resources owners can grant or deny your app (the client) access to the resources they own. For example, your app might call an external system's API to get a user's email address from their profile on that system.

170
sklearn
permutation_test_score: This function assesses model performance by computing a baseline distribution of scores via label permutation, creating a null hypothesis benchmark. Comparing the model’s score to this distribution reveals whether its performance is significant or due to random chance.





171
sklearn
When evaluating the resulting model it is important to do it on held-out samples that were not seen during the grid search process: it is recommended to split the data into a development set (to be fed to the GridSearchCV instance) and an evaluation set to compute performance metrics.





172
sklearn
The classes in sklearn.neighbors can handle either NumPy arrays or scipy.sparse matrices as input. For dense matrices, a large number of possible distance metrics are supported. For sparse matrices, arbitrary Minkowski metrics are supported for searches.

CDK Global Ransomeware, June 2024
Integrating CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) within SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platforms helps anticipate attacker moves. By aligning defenses with known TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), organizations achieve earlier detection, improved response, and neutralize evolving ransomware variants before damage.





222
Python
More coding languages are supported in TensorFlow than in PyTorch, which has a C++ API. You can use TensorFlow in both JavaScript and Swift. If you don’t want to write much low-level code, then Keras abstracts away a lot of the details for common use cases so you can build TensorFlow models without sweating the details.





223
Python
In Python, special methods support comparison operators.

For example, the .__lt__() method supports the < operator, .__gt__() supports >, and the .__eq__() method supports the == operator.

These methods allow you to define custom behavior for comparison operations in your custom classes.





224
Python
According to the HTTP specification, POST, PUT, and the less common PATCH requests pass their data through the message body rather than through parameters in the query string. Using Requests, you’ll pass the payload to the corresponding function’s data parameter.

data takes a dictionary, a list of tuples, bytes, or a file-like object.





225
Python
When you make a request, the Requests library prepares the request before actually sending it to the destination server. Request preparation includes things like validating headers and serializing JSON content.

You can view the PreparedRequest object by accessing .request on a Response object:





226
Python
Because the decoding of bytes to a str requires an encoding scheme, Requests will try to guess the encoding based on the response’s headers if you don’t specify one. You can provide an explicit encoding by setting .encoding before accessing .text:

>>> response.encoding = "utf-8"  # Optional: Requests infers this.
>>> response.text
'{"current_user_url":"https://api.github.com/user", ...}'

Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker images are stored and made available in registries. A registry is a web service to which Docker can connect to upload and download container images. The most well-known registry is Docker Hub, which is a public registry. Many individuals and organizations publish images to Docker Hub, and you can download and run these images using Docker running on your desktop, on a server, or in the cloud.





243
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
The bridge network is the default configuration applied to containers when launched without specifying any other network configuration. This network is an internal, private network used by the container, and it isolates the container network from the Docker host network.





244
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A volume is stored on the host filesystem at a specific folder location. Choose a folder where you know the data won't be modified by non-Docker processes.

Docker creates and manages the new volume by running the docker volume create command. This command can form part of our Dockerfile definition, which means that you can create volumes as part of the container-creation process. Docker creates the volume if it doesn't exist when you try to mount the volume into a container the first time.





245
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
If you need to terminate the container, use the kill command to send a kill signal. The container's kernel captures the kill signal, but the running process doesn't. This command forcefully terminates the working process in the container.

Lastly, to remove containers that are in a stopped state, use the remove command. After removing a container, all data stored in the container gets destroyed.





246
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
To place a container in the run state, use the run command. You can also restart a container that's already running. When restarting a container, the container receives a termination signal to enable any running processes to shut down gracefully before the container's kernel terminates.

Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker containers are the default container architecture the Azure containerization services use, and many other cloud platforms also support them.

For instance, you can deploy Docker containers to Azure Container Instances, Azure App Service, and Azure Kubernetes Services. Each of these options provides you with different features and capabilities.





305
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker containers provide security features to run multiple containers simultaneously on the same host without affecting each other. As we learned, we can configure both data storage and network configuration to isolate our containers or share data and connectivity between specific containers.





306
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker provides us with the docker stats command. This command returns information for the container such as percentage CPU usage, percentage memory usage, I/O written to disk, network data sent and received, and process IDs assigned. This information is useful as an immediate data stream; however, no aggregation is done, because the data isn't stored. We'd have to install third-party software for meaningful data capture over a period of time.





307
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
1. A container is launched using the --publish 8080:80 flag. Which of the following options is the most likely network configuration used for the container? 
The Bridge network configuration is an internal, private network used by the container and isolates the container network from the Docker host network. We use the publish flag to map ports between the container and host ports.





308
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
To pause a running container, use the pause command. This command suspends all processes in the container.

To stop a running container, use the stop command. The stop command enables the working process to shut down gracefully by sending it a termination signal. The container's kernel terminates after the process shuts down.





309
