TSQL
CASE Expressions:

Implements conditional logic within queries to create computed columns or flags (e.g., flagging which date or account source is used).





4
TSQL
Table Variables:

Declared using DECLARE and used similarly to temporary tables, often for smaller data sets with a more limited scope.





5
TSQL
Transactions and Isolation Levels:

Use BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK to group related SQL statements, ensuring data integrity.
Isolation levels (e.g., READ COMMITTED) manage concurrency and data consistency.

Power BI
Q: What is the effect of data type mismatches on Power Query folding and performance?
    A:

    If you change a column’s data type (e.g., from text to date) before filtering, Power Query may break folding because the source might not support that conversion natively.

    Always apply type conversions at the end, after filters, or ensure the source can natively convert the type in the same query.





7
Power BI
Q: Name one alternative to the SQL connector when connecting to Dataverse that can improve folding and avoid timeouts.
A: Use the built-in Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector via Get Data → Dataverse. It often auto-folds better into Dataverse’s paging model than the SQL (TDS) endpoint.





8
Power BI
What’s the difference between SUMMARIZE and SUMMARIZECOLUMNS?
SUMMARIZE creates a virtual table using a row context that you must convert to filter context with CALCULATE, whereas SUMMARIZECOLUMNS works directly in filter context, handles aggregations and filter modifiers more predictably, and is optimized by the engine for better performance.





9
Power BI
Q: What is “query folding” and why does it matter for refresh timeouts?
A: Query folding means pushing filtering/sorting logic down to the data source. If a step breaks folding, Power Query pulls all rows client-side, increasing data volume and risking timeouts.

Package conffiles are different from all other files delivered in a package. A package may have any number of conffiles (including none!). Conffiles are explicitly marked by the package maintainer during development to protect local configuration from being overwritten during upgrades so that your changes are saved.





80
Ubuntu
Removing dependencies can, at worst, cause a system to become unusable – you should always be careful when doing so. If you remove a dependency that is part of a chain, the removals will cascade up the chain as each dependency and the package that depends on it are removed. You can end up removing more than you originally anticipated!





81
Ubuntu
Snaps are a newer, self-contained software format that were developed to be a more portable and easy-to-use alternative to debs.

139
Active Directory and Azure Files
Domain SID
The SID of the domain itself. Passed into Azure Files configuration so it can translate user/group SIDs correctly for access checks.





140
Active Directory and Azure Files
Azure Entra ID Kerberos (AAD Kerberos)
A newer model where Entra ID itself issues Kerberos tickets. Removes dependency on on-prem AD DS but behaves slightly differently.





141
Active Directory and Azure Files
Delegation of Control
Giving a non-admin user rights over a specific OU or object type (e.g., create/delete computer objects). Enables least-privilege administration.





142
Active Directory and Azure Files
Security Identifier (SID)

145
Active Directory and Azure Files
Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD)
Allows a service to impersonate users only to specific services. Again, not core to Azure Files, but important context for how Kerberos is normally “tightly scoped.”





146
Active Directory and Azure Files
KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED
Kerberos error meaning “the service ticket could not be validated by the target.” In Azure Files, this usually indicates the Kerberos key in AD doesn’t match the storage account’s key.





147
Active Directory and Azure Files
Private Endpoint DNS Resolution
Clients mounting Azure Files over Kerberos must resolve the file endpoint (<storageaccount>.file.core.windows.net) to the private endpoint’s IP.





148
Active Directory and Azure Files
Azure AD DS (Managed Domain)
A hosted domain service in Azure that provides AD DS without full domain controllers. Some orgs use this for Azure Files instead of extending their on-prem AD.





149
Terraform Codebox
CIFS (Common Internet File System)
A network file-sharing protocol used by Windows and supported on Linux via cifs-utils. It's used in Azure File Shares to mount a remote storage directory into a Linux VM as if it were a local folder.





150
Terraform Codebox
In Terraform, modules are reusable components that group resources together. You call them from the root module and pass in variables. Modules don't run independently; they're included via the module block in your main configuration.


hcl
module "vm" {
  source = "./modules/ephemeral"
  vm_name = "dev-vm"
}





151
Terraform Codebox
In a Terraform module, names like "main" or "this" are user-defined labels for a resource block. They are not reserved words — you can choose meaningful names to reference resources elsewhere in your config.


hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "this" { ... }
# Reference: azurerm_storage_account.this.name





152
Terraform Codebox
SSH keys are used to securely authenticate to a VM. Terraform expects you to pass the public key path and inject it into the VM at creation, enabling key-based access instead of passwords.

Example in variables.tf:

hcl
variable "ssh_public_key_path" {
  default = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
}





153
Terraform Codebox
Terraform provider blocks declare which cloud or service you're configuring. You must include a provider block like azurerm in the root module, even if the actual resources are defined in submodules.


hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  use_cli = true
}





154
Terraform Codebox
fallocate -l
A Linux command used to create a file of a specified size efficiently without actually writing data. Used to quickly set up a swap file or allocate disk space for testing.





155
Terraform Codebox
/usr/local/bin
A standard directory in Unix-like systems for storing user-installed executable binaries. It’s typically in the system’s PATH, making anything you move there globally accessible from the command line.





156
Terraform Codebox
The cloud-init mechanism in Azure allows Terraform to provision the VM on first boot, such as installing software, mounting storage, or configuring files.

Example inside VM block:

hcl
custom_data = base64encode(templatefile("${path.module}/cloud-init.yaml.tpl", {...}))





157
Terraform Codebox
swapon / mkswap
mkswap formats a file to be used as swap space. swapon activates it, allowing the system to treat it like virtual memory. Useful on VMs with low RAM to avoid crashing during memory spikes.





158
Terraform Codebox
Output values expose key info (like public IPs) after apply. They can be used to chain modules or help humans connect to deployed infrastructure.


hcl
output "ip" {
  value = azurerm_public_ip.this.ip_address
}





159
Terraform Codebox
The templatefile() function loads a local file and injects variables, often used to populate dynamic scripts, like cloud-init.


hcl
templatefile("${path.module}/cloud-init.yaml.tpl", {
  share_name = var.share_name
})





160
Terraform Codebox
VS Code Remote - SSH extension allows you to edit files and run terminals directly inside a remote VM. Great when you can’t install tools locally.

The access tier of the file share dictates to the ratio of storage to IOPS/throughput costs (in the form of transactions). There are three access tiers: transaction optimized, hot, and cool. Changing the tier of the Azure file share results in transaction costs for the movement to the new access tier.





225
Azure Files Documentation
Classic file shares, and the child objects for other storage services like blob containers, that live within the same storage account share a common pool of storage, IOPS, and throughput. This means placing multiple classic file shares in a storage account requires planning to avoid capacity bottlenecks

Ubuntu
Installing deb packages using APT is done using the apt install command. We can install either a single package or a list of packages at once by including their names in a space separated list after the install command in this format:

    sudo apt install <package1> <package2> <package3>





353
Ubuntu
Every Ubuntu series (noble, jammy, etc) is split into pockets, which are related to the software development/release lifecycle:

    -release contains the packages as they are at release time.

    -proposed contains package updates while they are being tested.

    Once an update is released, they come from either -security or -updates depending on whether they are a security-related update or not.

    And -backports, which contains packages that were not available at release time.





354
Ubuntu
The first thing we always want to do with a new system (whether a VM, container, bare metal, or cloud instance) is to make sure we have the latest versions of all the pre-installed software.





355
Ubuntu
Debian policy on binary dependencies
    depends: Absolutely required, the package won’t work without it. If we try to remove a package that is depended on by another, both will be removed!
    recommends
    suggests





356
Ubuntu
Most of a package’s configuration is handled through configuration files (often known as conffiles). Conffiles often contain things like file paths, logs and debugging configuration, kernel parameters (which can be changed to optimize system performance), access control, and other configuration settings.





357
Ubuntu
To remove an application with apt, including all conffiles, we add the --purge option to the apt remove command. Remember to use `sudo apt autoremove` to get rid of them.

sudo apt remove --purge apache2





358
Ubuntu
Each pocket is split into four components, depending on whether the packages they contain are open source or closed source, and whether they are officially supported by Canonical or are maintained by the Ubuntu Community

...  | Open Source | Closed Source
Officially Supported | main | reestricted
Community supported | universe | multiverse





359
Ubuntu
If we find a file but we’re not sure what package it comes from, dpkg can help us there too! Let’s use the example of one of the files from the previous output: /usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf and do a search for it using dpkg:

dpkg --search /usr/share/ssl-cert/ssleay.cnf





360
Ubuntu
Every Linux distribution has their own preferred package manager for installing, updating and removing packages. In Ubuntu, the default package manager is Advanced Packaging Tool (or APT, for short).





361
SSH + SCP
Identity File (-i)
The private key file path used by ssh/scp for authentication. It must be the private key (e.g., ~/.ssh/id_rsa), not authorized_keys.





362
SSH + SCP
Azure “Reset password” (Portal)
Portal action that can reset a user’s SSH public key on the VM. Useful when authorized_keys is broken or inaccessible; it writes a new public key for the target username.





363
SSH + SCP

Verbose flags that show handshake details, which identity files are offered, whether the server accepts the key, and the reason for failures (very helpful for debugging).





366
SSH + SCP
StrictModes (sshd)
A server‑side option that enforces safe file permissions on user home and .ssh files. If perms are too open, pubkey auth is refused to prevent key theft.





367
SSH + SCP
PasswordAuthentication (sshd)
Server setting controlling whether SSH allows password login. If disabled, only key‑based login works; you must have your public key in authorized_keys.





368
SSH + SCP
Public Key Authentication (SSH)
A method where the client proves identity using a private key while the server checks the corresponding public key in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys. No password is sent; authentication succeeds if the key pair matches and permissions are correct.





369
SSH + SCP
PermitRootLogin (sshd)
Controls whether root can log in directly over SSH. Commonly disabled for security; use sudo from a normal user instead.





370
SSH + SCP
Recursive Copy with SCP
Use -r to copy directories. Example:
scp -r -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa /home/azureuser user@host:/home/azureuser/target/





371

PATH Resolution Order - When you type a command:
    Current directory
    PATH entries (left to right)
    Windows system directories (e.g., System32)





379
Windows PATH Variable
Temporary PATH Change
A modification that applies only to the current session. Example in PowerShell:
    PowerShell
    $env:Path = "C:\Tools;" + $env:Path





380
Windows PATH Variable
PATH Length Limit
Historically, Windows had a limit of around 2048 characters for PATH. Modern versions allow much longer strings, but tools like setx may truncate if the PATH is extremely long.

Holds promise callbacks (.then, .catch, .finally) and process.nextTick in Node.js. Microtasks always run before the next macrotask.





443
JavaScript Concepts
With Boolean(value) you can convert any value to a boolean. There is a fixed set of values, so called falsy values, that convert to false. Most importantly, false, 0, empty string, null, undefined and NaN are falsy.
Boolean(-1);// => true
Boolean(0);// => false
Boolean(' ');// => true
Boolean('');// => false

Promise.all() / allSettled() / race() / any()
Utilities to coordinate multiple promises:

  all: wait for all to succeed (or fail-fast)

  allSettled: wait for all to settle, regardless of outcome

  race: settle as soon as one settles

  any: succeed as soon as one fulfills (rejects if all reject)





445
JavaScript Concepts
Using Object.entries(): The Object.entries() method returns an array of the object's own enumerable property [key, value] pairs. You can use the for...of loop to iterate over these pairs1.

We recommend you begin with the preset security policies in Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Defender for Office 365 fast by assigning them to specific pilot users or defined groups as part of your evaluation.





464
Exchange Online and Defender
Protection features have an unconfigurable order of processing. For example, incoming messages are always evaluated for malware before spam.
The threat policies of a specific feature (anti-spam, anti-malware, anti-phishing, etc.) are applied in a specific order of precedence.





465
Exchange Online and Defender
If you're using the *.onmicrosoft.com domain for email (also known as the Microsoft Online Email Routing Address or MOERA domain), there's not nearly as much for you to do: 

SPF and DKIM are configured automatically
DMARC still needs to be manually set up via DNS records.

Microsoft Purview
The technical metadata includes schema, data type, columns, and so on, that are discovered during Microsoft Purview scanning. The business metadata includes automated (for example, promoted from Power BI datasets, or descriptions from SQL tables) and manual tagging of descriptions, glossary terms, and so on.





473
Microsoft Purview
Microsoft Purview comes with preconfigured DLP templates for Financial, Medical and health, and Privacy policy templates. Additionally, you can build your own using the Custom template. As you design and create your actual DLP policies, having a working knowledge of the sensitive items you need to protect helps you choose the right sensitive information type.

As you work with Data Map and Unified Catalog, keep these points in mind:

    All data in Data Map and Unified Catalog is metadata, not the underlying data itself.
    None of the permissions or roles in Data Map or Unified Catalog provide access to underlying data itself.





475
Microsoft Purview
The Microsoft Purview Data Map provides the foundation for data discovery and data governance. It captures metadata about data present in analytics, software-as-a-service (SaaS), and operational systems in hybrid, on-premises, and multicloud environments. The data map stays up to date with its built-in scanning and classification system.





476
Microsoft Purview
All DLP policies are created and maintained in the Microsoft Purview portal. See Create and Deploy data loss prevention policies for more information. 
After you create a DLP policy, it's stored in a central policy store and then synced to the various content sources.





477
Microsoft Purview
DLP policies can be applied to the following locations:
    Exchange online email
    SharePoint sites
    OneDrive accounts
    Teams chat and channel messages
    Windows 10, 11 and macOS Devices
    Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
    On-premises repositories

The Groups & sites scope becomes available and selected by default when you enable sensitivity labels for containers and synchronize labels. This option lets you protect content in SharePoint sites, Teams sites, and Loop workspaces by labeling those containers but doesn't label the items in them.





481
Microsoft Purview
Run the policy in simulation mode, without Policy Tips and then use the DLP reports, and any incident reports, to assess the impact of the policies. You can use DLP reports to view the number, location, type, and severity of policy matches. Based on the results, you can fine-tune your policies as needed.

You can perform both item-level and share-level restores in the Azure portal using Azure Backup. All you need to do is choose the restore point (a particular snapshot), the particular file or directory if relevant, and then the location (original or alternate) you wish you restore to.





487
Azure Files Documentation
Azure file shares use the Kerberos protocol to authenticate with an identity source. When an identity associated with a user or application running on a client attempts to access data in Azure file shares, the request is sent to the identity source to authenticate the identity.

File shares (preview), offered by the Microsoft.FileShares resource provider. File shares are a new top-level resource that simplify the deployment of Azure Files by eliminating the storage account. Unlike classic file shares, which must be deployed into a storage account, file shares are deployed directly into the resource group like storage accounts themselves





492
Azure Files Documentation
The set of message packets that defines a particular version of the protocol is called a dialect. The Common Internet File System (CIFS) Protocol is a dialect of SMB. Both SMB and CIFS are also available on VMS, several versions of Unix, and other operating systems.





493
Azure Files Documentation
In the OSI networking model, Microsoft SMB Protocol is most often used as an Application layer or a Presentation layer protocol, and it relies on lower-level protocols for transport. The transport layer protocol that Microsoft SMB Protocol is most often used with is NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT).





494
Azure Files Documentation
Using the storage account key to mount the Azure file share is effectively an administrator operation, because the mounted file share has full permissions to all of the files and folders on the share, even if they have ACLs. When using the storage account key to mount over SMB, the NTLMv2 authentication protocol is used.





495
Azure Files Documentation
In general, mounting a file share can be simply achieved on Windows using a standard “net use” command. When you create a share, the Azure Portal automatically generates a “net use” command and makes it available for copy and pasting: look for the "Connect" button.

Azure Files Documentation
Azure AD Connect V1 has been retired as of August 31, 2022 and is no longer supported. Azure AD Connect V1 installations may stop working unexpectedly. If you are still using an Azure AD Connect V1 you need to upgrade to Microsoft Entra Connect V2 immediately.





497
Azure Files Documentation
You can back up your Azure file share via share snapshots, which are read-only, point-in-time copies of your share. Snapshots are incremental, meaning they only contain as much data as has changed since the previous snapshot. You can have up to 200 snapshots per file share and retain them for up to 10 years.





498
Azure Files Documentation
NFS file shares rely on network-level authentication and are therefore only accessible via restricted networks. Using an NFS file share always requires some level of networking configuration.





499
Azure Files Documentation
You can access your Azure file shares over the public internet accessible endpoint, over one or more private endpoints on your network(s), or by caching your Azure file share on-premises with Azure File Sync (SMB file shares only).

eDiscovery
You're troubleshooting a hold and see an error for a SharePoint site. The hold status says 'read-only site.' What should you do?

Make the site writable, then retry the policy





535
eDiscovery
eDiscovery is a process used to identify, collect, and produce electronically stored information (ESI) during legal proceedings, internal investigations, audits, or regulatory reviews. This could include emails, chat messages, documents, or anything else stored digitally that's relevant to a case.





536
eDiscovery
When you add a user or group to a case, eDiscovery automatically identifies and includes related locations. Data sources can include:

User mailboxes (email and calendar items)
OneDrive sites (files owned by the user)
SharePoint sites (including Teams channel files)
Teams messages (captured in Exchange mailboxes)
Yammer messages (if Yammer is enabled)
Public folders





537
eDiscovery
When you apply a keyword filter, you can search across document content using search terms or even structured KQL-like syntax. Use Boolean operators such as AND, OR, NOT, and NEAR, and wildcards like ? and * to find partial matches. Keyword filters work well for narrowing down to items that mention specific terms in the body of emails or documents.





538
eDiscovery
You can scope data sources in two ways:

Specific sources let you select individual users, groups, or sites
Tenant-wide sources include options like All people and groups or All public folders





539
eDiscovery
By default, review set items appear in pages of 50. Use the navigation controls to move between pages or enter a page number directly. If you prefer to scroll through all content without breaks, go to Manage and select Turn pagination off.





540
eDiscovery
In Microsoft Purview eDiscovery, preserve content that could be relevant to the case by placing content locations such as mailboxes, SharePoint sites, and OneDrive accounts on hold. This action prevents data from being permanently deleted until the hold is removed or the case is closed.





541
eDiscovery
You add a Microsoft 365 group as a data source, but you need to make sure chat messages and shared files from individual members are also preserved. What should you do?

Add individual group members as separate sources





542
eDiscovery
Why is every eDiscovery search in Microsoft Purview associated with a case?

To control access and provide an auditable investigation workspace.





543
eDiscovery
From the Case settings page, select Data sources, then choose one or more of the following options:

All people and groups including unlicensed, on-premises, and guest users
All people and groups including shared Teams channels
All people and groups including departed users





544
eDiscovery
A legal team is reviewing content in a case and wants to maintain a consistent, auditable record of data added for analysis. Why would they use a review set in Microsoft Purview eDiscovery?

To store a static set of content for focused review and tagging.





545
eDiscovery
eDiscovery uses real-time sync to track changes in associated content. If a user's data locations change, such as when a new Teams private channel is created, you'll see an alert in the data source panel so you can include the new location.





546
eDiscovery
A hold was applied last week, but one user's OneDrive URL changed after a UPN update. What should you do?

Update the source path to reflect the new URL





547
eDiscovery
Your organization is deciding whether to use the classic or new eDiscovery experience. They want to take advantage of automatic indexing and review sets. Which experience should they use?
    New eDiscovery





548
eDiscovery
In Microsoft Purview eDiscovery, review sets are created as containers for holding static copies of content you want to analyze. You can create a review set on its own and add data later, or you can create one directly from a search.





549
eDiscovery
Access control is essential in Microsoft Purview eDiscovery. Case access is restricted to designated users and role groups, helping ensure sensitive investigations stay secure and traceable. Before someone can contribute to or review case content, they must have the appropriate permissions and be added to the case.





550
eDiscovery
You're analyzing a large volume of email data in a review set. What's the benefit of running analytics before starting manual review?

It reduces review volume by grouping near-duplicates and identifying key emails.





551
eDiscovery
A security analyst wants to include data from shared Teams channels and departed users in their search. What should they do?

Enable more data sources in the case settings.





552
Accounting
Contra-Asset Account
An account that offsets the balance of a related asset account. Example: Accumulated Depreciation reduces Equipment value.





553
TSQL
Indexing Considerations:

Ensure columns used in JOINs or WHERE clauses are indexed for better performance.





554
TSQL
Set Operations:

UNION / UNION ALL: Combine result sets from multiple queries (with or without duplicate removal).
INTERSECT: Returns rows common to both queries.
EXCEPT: Returns rows from the first query that do not appear in the second.





555
Power BI
Q: What is VertiPaq and why is it relevant when appending tables?
A: VertiPaq is Power BI’s in‐memory columnar engine. When appending tables with identical schemas, VertiPaq compresses and merges columns efficiently, making the in‐memory append step very fast.





556
Power BI
When would you use GENERATESERIES in DAX?
GENERATESERIES(start, end, increment) produces a single-column table of numeric values at the specified step size. It’s useful for creating bins or ranges (for example, percentage buckets) for frequency analysis.





557
Power BI
What’s the scope of variables (VAR) inside an ADDCOLUMNS column definition?
A VAR declared inside one column’s definition lives only within that column. To share results, you must either repeat the logic or separate the columns into multiple ADDCOLUMNS calls so that the column values exist in the table.

Ubuntu
There are two types of software found in Ubuntu: Debian packages and snaps. Snaps are self-contained applications running in a sandbox with mediated access to the host system.





618
Ubuntu
Debian policy on binary dependencies
    depends
    recommends: Strongly dependent, but not absolutely necessary (which means the package will work better with it, but can still function without it)
    suggests





619
Ubuntu
In Ubuntu, the default configuration of apt install is set to install recommended packages alongside depends, so when we ran the apt install apache2 command, ssl-cert was included in the proposed packages to be installed. We can override this behavior by passing the --no-install-recommends flag to our command, like this:

    sudo apt install apache2 --no-install-recommends





620
Ubuntu
APT has recently been streamlined, so although it uses apt-get and apt-cache “behind the scenes” (and these commands do still work), we don’t need to worry about remembering which command to use – we can use the more convenient apt directly.





621
Ubuntu
In many places, you will see reference to apt-get and apt-cache instead of apt. Historically, the database part of APT was accessed using apt-cache (e.g. apt-cache show ipcalc), and the packages part of APT used apt-get (e.g. apt-get install ipcalc).





622
Ubuntu
We can install .deb files that aren’t in the APT repository using dpkg – all we need is to download the .deb file, and we can run a command like this to install it:

sudo dpkg -i <file-name.deb>





623
Ubuntu
The series is a set of packages that are released with a specific version of Ubuntu – they’re usually referred to by their codename (e.g., mantic, noble and oracular in our diagram). Each version of Ubuntu may have multiple releases (for example, an LTS will have an initial release when it launches (e.g. 24.04 LTS), and then “subsequent point releases” (e.g. 24.04.1 LTS) – these are all part of the same series (noble).





624
Ubuntu
Once you have installed and run Multipass, it is straightforward to launch a new VM. Let us launch a VM using the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS release (codename noble), and let’s give our VM the name tutorial using the following command in our terminal window:

    multipass launch noble --name tutorial

SSH + SCP
OpenSSH Private Key Format
A text format starting with -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY----- and ending with -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----. It encodes the private key (optionally encrypted with a passphrase).





626
SSH + SCP
Required Permissions for SSH Keys
~/.ssh must be 700; private keys must be 600; authorized_keys must be 600. Too‑open permissions cause OpenSSH to reject key auth (security feature).





627
SSH + SCP
SSH Agent
A local process that holds decrypted private keys in memory so you don’t re‑enter passphrases. Programs like ssh can ask the agent to perform signatures without touching the key file again.





628
SSH + SCP
authorized_keys
A file on the destination host that lists allowed public keys (one per line) for a user. OpenSSH reads it during login; incorrect permissions or ownership will cause key rejection.





629
SSH + SCP
ED25519 vs RSA
ED25519: modern, fast, small keys, strong security with short fingerprints.
RSA: widely compatible; larger keys; still common but ED25519 preferred when supported.





630
SSH + SCP
Public Key Comment Field
The trailing text on a public key line (after the Base64 blob). It’s optional metadata (e.g., jay@host) to identify the key’s origin; not used for authentication.





631
SSH + SCP
~/.ssh/config
Per‑user SSH configuration file. You can set defaults:
Host myvm
  HostName 13.91.121.65
  User azureuser
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Then connect with ssh myvm.





632
SSH + SCP
Ciphers and MACs (SSH)
Ciphers like aes128-gcm or chacha20‑poly1305 encrypt data; MACs (or AEAD modes) ensure integrity. Prefer modern AEAD ciphers for speed and security.





633
SSH + SCP
PEM vs OpenSSH Keys
PEM is a generic container often used for TLS/SSH keys (.pem). OpenSSH can read PEM and its own modern OpenSSH format. Cloud tools sometimes expect PEM; PuTTY expects PPK.





634
Windows PATH Variable
Permanent Scope
Changes that persist across sessions and reboots. These are applied by editing environment variables through the GUI or using commands like setx. Permanent changes are stored in the Windows registry.





635
Windows PATH Variable
Registry Storage
Permanent environment variables are stored in the Windows Registry:

System Variables: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment
User Variables: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment





636
Windows PATH Variable
$env:Path
A PowerShell variable that represents the current PATH for the active session. You can read or modify it directly, but changes here are temporary unless you use setx or the GUI.





637
Windows PATH Variable
PATH Injection Risk
If a malicious directory is added early in PATH, it can override trusted executables.
Best practice: Keep system directories first and avoid adding writable folders.





638
Windows PATH Variable
setx
A command-line tool that writes environment variables permanently to the user or system scope. Unlike set, which is temporary, setx updates the registry so changes persist after reboot. However, it does not affect the current session immediately.





639
Windows PATH Variable
Backup
Saving the current PATH before making changes to avoid accidental loss. Example in PowerShell:
    PowerShell
    $env:Path | Out-File "$env:USERPROFILE\path_backup.txt"





640
Windows PATH Variable
Delimiter
The character used to separate multiple entries in the PATH variable. On Windows, this is a semicolon (;). Each directory in PATH must be separated by this character.





641
Windows PATH Variable
Environment Variable Expansion
Variables can reference other variables:
    Example:
    BAT
    set PATH=%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin

    In PowerShell:
    PowerShell$env:Path += ";$env:JAVA_HOME\bin"





642
Windows PATH Variable
Session Scope
Changes made to environment variables that only last for the current shell session. For example, modifying $env:Path in PowerShell or using set in CMD affects only that window and disappears when you close it.





643
Windows PATH Variable
Order Matters
Windows searches PATH entries from left to right. Placing frequently used directories earlier can speed up command resolution.

An attribute on an AD object that maps a service instance to that account. For Azure Files, the SPN is:
cifs/<storageaccount>.file.core.windows.net





678
Active Directory and Azure Files
Discretionary ACL (DACL)
Defines who is allowed or denied access. The type you’ll be working with when setting NTFS permissions on Azure Files.





679
Active Directory and Azure Files
Duplicate SPN
A misconfiguration where two AD objects both claim the same SPN. Kerberos can’t decide which to use, so authentication fails.





680
Active Directory and Azure Files
User Account
An AD object representing a person or service. Not recommended for Azure Files because passwords usually expire.





681
Active Directory and Azure Files
Token Groups
When a user logs in, AD builds a token containing all their SIDs (user SID + group SIDs). This token is compared against ACLs.





682
Active Directory and Azure Files
Global Catalog (GC)
A special role of certain domain controllers. Stores a partial replica of all objects in the forest. Helps with lookups across domains.





683
Active Directory and Azure Files
Azure Private Endpoint
A network interface in your VNet that maps a private IP to a PaaS resource. For Azure Files, it’s how on-prem clients connect securely without relying on public 445.





684
Active Directory and Azure Files
Time Skew
Kerberos is sensitive to clock drift. If a client and DC differ by more than ~5 minutes, tickets are rejected. Important when mixing on-prem and cloud.





685
Terraform Codebox
exercism configure
A CLI command used to link the Exercism CLI to your account. It sets your API token and optionally configures your local workspace directory, so you can download and submit coding exercises.





686
Terraform Codebox
journalctl
A log viewing tool used to inspect logs generated by systemd services. For example, journalctl -xe shows the latest system events — useful for debugging issues like failed mounts or cloud-init errors.





687
Terraform Codebox
In Windows PowerShell, RSA SSH keys can be generated using ssh-keygen. The key pair should be placed in C:\Users\<YourName>\.ssh\, with the public key path passed into Terraform.


powershell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_rsa





688
Terraform Codebox
Terraform modules allow you to organize and reuse code. You can define a VM, network, or storage module once and use it in multiple places with different variables passed in.

Example root call:

hcl
module "ephemeral" {
  source = "./modules/ephemeral"
  vm_name = "devbox"
}





689
Terraform Codebox
file command
Used to inspect the type of a file based on its content, not its extension. Helpful when downloading files with tools like curl to check whether a .tar.gz is really a binary or an HTML error page.





690
Terraform Codebox
ARM Template vs Terraform: Both are infrastructure-as-code for Azure, but Terraform is multi-cloud, more modular, and readable. ARM is native to Azure and more verbose.





691
Terraform Codebox
Systemd unit files (*.service)
Configuration files that define how a service should start, stop, and behave under systemd. Services like snapd, cloud-init, or ssh rely on these for lifecycle management on modern Linux distros.





692
Terraform Codebox
Data sources in Terraform let you read existing cloud resources without managing them. You use them when you want to reference things created outside of Terraform.


hcl
data "azurerm_client_config" "current" {}





693
Terraform Codebox
/tmp directory
A temporary directory used for short-lived files. It's often cleared on reboot and used by installers, compilers, or cloud-init scripts to stage downloads and extracted files before moving them to permanent locations.





694
Terraform Codebox
chmod 600
A command that sets file permissions to read/write for the owner only. Commonly used on sensitive files like SSH keys or swapfiles to prevent unauthorized access.





695
Terraform Codebox
Resource Naming: Use formatdate() or timestamp() to dynamically add creation dates to resources like VMs.


hcl
locals {
  creation_date = formatdate("YYYYMMDD", timestamp())
}





696
JavaScript Concepts
Unique Names: All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names, called identifiers. These names can be short (like x and y) or more descriptive (like age, sum, totalVolume). Identifiers can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but they must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign1.





697
JavaScript Concepts
setTimeout / setImmediate / process.nextTick
Node/browser scheduling APIs:

    setTimeout(fn, 0): next macrotask

    setImmediate(fn): “check” phase in Node (after I/O)

    process.nextTick(fn): before the next event‑loop phase (Node only)





698
JavaScript Concepts
Variable Declarations (let, const, var): Keywords to declare variables with different scopes and mutability. let and const are block-scoped, while var is function-scoped.





699
JavaScript Concepts
In many cases, it makes sense to assign a more appropriate default value than undefined. This can be done by specifying default parameters directly in the function definition.

function someName(param1 = defaultValue1, param2 = defaultValue2) {
  // ...
}

JavaScript Concepts
Webpack: A powerful module bundler that compiles JavaScript modules into a single bundle, optimizing assets for production.





701
JavaScript Concepts
Call Stack
A LIFO stack of frames representing currently executing functions. When it’s empty, the event loop can pick up queued callbacks.





702
JavaScript Concepts
To create a deep copy of an object in JavaScript, you can use the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object)) method. This approach works well for simple objects, such as those with string:number pairs, and ensures that the original object remains unmodified.





703
JavaScript Concepts
Callback Hell / Pyramid of Doom
Deeply nested callbacks that become hard to read and maintain. Promises and async/await help flatten this.





704
JavaScript Concepts
Vue.js: A progressive framework for building user interfaces, known for its simplicity and flexibility, with features like directives and single-file components.





705
JavaScript Concepts
Promise
An object representing the eventual outcome of an asynchronous operation:
  Pending – neither fulfilled nor rejected

  Fulfilled – operation succeeded, value available

  Rejected – operation failed, reason available





706
JavaScript Concepts
Object literal { length: n } is just “array-like”: any object with a numeric .length can drive Array.from.
  let cols = Array.from({ length: n }, () => [])





707
JavaScript Concepts
Front: What are tagged templates and how do you use them?

Back: Tagged templates allow you to parse template literals with a function. The function receives the template string and the values as arguments.
  function tag(strings, ...values) {
  console.log(strings); // Array of string segments
  console.log(values);  // Array of values
  return 'Tagged template result';
}
const result = tag`Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(result); // Output: Tagged template result

Exchange Online and Defender
Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC): Specifies the action for messages that fail SPF or DKIM checks for senders in the domain, and specifies where to send the DMARC results (reporting).





721
Exchange Online and Defender
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) allows email users to help protect sensitive information by sending signed and encrypted email within their organization. As an administrator, you can enable S/MIME-based security for your organization if you have mailboxes in either Exchange Server or Exchange Online.





722
Exchange Online and Defender
Sender Policy Framework (SPF): The SPF TXT record identifies valid sources of email from senders in the domain. For instructions, see Set up SPF to identify valid email sources for your custom cloud domains.

Archive mailboxes (called In-Place Archiving) let people in your Microsoft 365 or Office 365 organization take control of messaging data by providing additional email storage.





724
Exchange Online and Defender
A valid, consistent HELO value affects deliverability
    Receiving servers often inspect the HELO identity as a hygiene and reputation signal.
    A mismatch, nonexistent domain, or generic hostname (e.g., localhost) can contribute to spam classification or rejection.
    While DMARC does not directly use HELO, SPF checks can, and mailbox providers use its validity as a trust indicator.





725
Exchange Online and Defender
You can use auditing solutions in Microsoft Purview to track changes made to your Exchange Online configuration by Microsoft and by your organization's administrators, and to audit mailbox access by persons other than the mailbox owner.





726
Exchange Online and Defender
You can't create allow entries directly in the Tenant Allow/Block List for the following items:

    Malware or high confidence phishing verdicts for domains and email addresses or URLs.
    Any verdicts for files.

Litigation Hold allows you to preserve or archive mailbox content for compliance and eDiscovery.





728
Exchange Online and Defender
HELO is required for legacy/standard SMTP (non‑ESMTP)
    Every SMTP server that follows the basic SMTP specification must support HELO.
    It is the minimal handshake required before any mail transaction can proceed.
    If a server does not support ESMTP extensions, HELO—not EHLO—will be used.





729
Exchange Online and Defender
Once the first threat policy is applied to a specific item for a user, policy processing for that feature stops. No more threat policies of that feature are evaluated for that user and that specific item.





730
Exchange Online and Defender
A standard SMTP email message consists of a message envelope and message content:

The message envelope contains information for transmitting and receiving the message between SMTP servers. The message envelope is described in RFC 5321. Recipients never see the message envelope because it's generated during the message transmission process.





731
Exchange Online and Defender
You can preserve the contents of deleted mailboxes indefinitely by using inactive mailboxes. You can make an inactive mailbox by placing an In-Place Hold or a Litigation Hold on the mailbox, and then deleting the corresponding user account.





732
Exchange Online and Defender
Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC): DMARC helps destination email servers decide what to do with messages from the custom domain that fail SPF and DKIM checks. Be sure to include the DMARC policy (p=reject or p=quarantine) and DMARC report destinations (aggregate and forensic reports) in the DMARC records.

DLP policies are how you monitor the activities that users take on sensitive items at rest, sensitive items in transit, or sensitive items in use and then take protective actions. For example, when a user attempts a prohibited action, like copying a sensitive item to an unapproved location or sharing medical information in an email, DLP can:

show a pop-up policy tip to the user that warns them that they might be trying to share a sensitive item inappropriately

Soft delete is a storage-account level setting that allows you to recover your file share when it's accidentally deleted. When a file share is deleted, it transitions to a soft deleted state instead of being permanently erased. You can configure the amount of time soft deleted shares are recoverable before they're permanently deleted.





747
Azure Files Documentation
Many important settings, such as network and security rules, are applied at the storage account level. You should consider the storage account to be a trust boundary and only place classic file shares in the same storage account if you're ok with them having the same security settings.





748
Azure Files Documentation
Pay-as-you-go storage accounts are distinguished using the StorageV2 storage account kind. 
They allow you to deploy file shares on HDD based hardware. 
They can be used to store classic file shares and other storage resources such as blob containers, queues, or tables.

Enabling AD DS authentication for your Azure file shares allows you to authenticate to your Azure file shares with your on-premises AD DS credentials. Further, it allows you to better manage your permissions to allow granular access control.





754
Azure Files Documentation
To enable AD DS authentication over SMB for Azure file shares, you need to register your Azure storage account with your on-premises AD DS and then set the required domain properties on the storage account. To register your storage account with AD DS, you create a computer account (or service logon account) representing it in your AD DS.

Q:
How does using yield from affect the performance of a generator?

A:
yield from can improve performance by delegating part of the generator’s operations to another generator, reducing overhead and simplifying code.

Example:
def generator1():
    yield from range(1000)

def generator2():
    yield from generator1()

# More efficient delegation

Python
Q:
How can generators be used to implement a producer-consumer pattern?

A:
Generators can act as producers by yielding data, which consumers can iterate over, allowing for efficient and decoupled data processing.

Example:
def producer():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i

def consumer(gen):
    for item in gen:
        print(f"Consumed: {item}")

gen = producer()
consumer(gen)

Q:
Explain the concept of generator pipelines.

A:
Generator pipelines involve chaining multiple generators together, where each generator processes data and passes it to the next, enabling efficient and modular data processing.

How can you safely delete a file using pathlib while handling potential exceptions by using a try-except block around the .unlink() method.

Example:
from pathlib import Path

file = Path('file_to_delete.txt')
try:
    file.unlink()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File does not exist.")
except PermissionError:
    print("Permission denied.")

Q:
Why should you prefer sys.exit() over exit() in production scripts?

A:
sys.exit() is more explicit and is the standard way to exit scripts, while exit() is intended for interactive shells and may not behave as expected in all environments.

Python
Q:
What is the benefit of using binary mode ('rb' or 'wb') when opening files with pathlib?

A:
Binary mode is useful for reading and writing non-text files (like images or executables) and ensures that data is handled as bytes, preventing encoding issues.

Python
Q:
What is the difference between yield and return in a generator function?

A:
yield produces a value and pauses the generator, allowing it to resume later, while return exits the function and optionally returns a value, terminating the generator.

Python
Zip Slip (Path Traversal Attack)
Malicious zips can contain members like ../../etc/passwd.
Naïve extractall() writes outside the intended folder.
Fix: use Path.resolve() to normalize paths and ensure they remain within a safe directory.

Python
Front: Will adding an empty __init__.py in your Azure Functions project root break the Azure Functions loader?
Back: No—as long as each function remains in its own folder with its own function.json and entry script, the root __init__.py won’t be treated as a function.

Python
File Extraction Safety
Always validate file paths when writing extracted or uploaded content.
Use .resolve() to normalize, and ensure the target directory is a parent of the resolved path.

Microsoft Purview integrates with Microsoft 365 services like Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, and Microsoft Defender to centralize the eDiscovery process. Instead of relying on manual collection or disconnected searches, Purview allows each step to be tracked, governed, and carried out consistently.





801
eDiscovery
Available options in Condition builder incldue:
    KeyQL: Write advanced queries using Keyword Query Language.
    Date: Filter content based on sent, received, or modified dates.
    Subject/Title: Match specific terms in email subjects or document titles.
    Participants: Filter by sender, recipient, or other participants.
    Type: Filter by message kind, such as Email, Chat, or Teams.

Each hold policy has a status that reflects its current state:

    Draft: The policy has been created but not applied. Navigating away before applying it discards the draft.
    On: The hold is active and content is being preserved.
    Off: The hold is no longer active, but the policy still exists.
    In progress: The policy is still applying or updating.
    Pending deletion: The policy is being deleted and is no longer preserving content.





806
