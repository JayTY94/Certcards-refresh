Generally, diagnostic analytics occurs in three steps:

	Identify anomalies in the data. These anomalies might be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.

	Collect data that's related to these anomalies.

	Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.

Proper management can also help reduce data silos within your organization. Data duplication can make managing and introducing data latency difficult when resources are overused. Power BI helps reduce data silos with the use of shared datasets, and it allows you to reuse data that you have prepared and modeled

The idea with a data lake is to store everything in its original, untransformed state. This approach differs from a traditional data warehouse, which transforms and processes the data at the time of ingestion.

Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened. Diagnostic analytics techniques supplement basic descriptive analytics, and they use the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of these events. Then, performance indicators are further investigated to discover why these events improved or became worse.

Azure Pipelines
A pipeline is made up of stages. A pipeline author can control whether a stage should run by defining conditions on the stage. Another way to control if and when a stage should run is through approvals and checks.




2
Azure Pipelines
Pipelines rely on resources such as environments, service connections, agent pools, variable groups, and secure files. Checks enable the resource owner to control if and when a stage in any pipeline can consume a resource. As an owner of a resource, you can define checks that must be satisfied before a stage consuming that resource can start.

Azure Pipelines
An example of a Pipeline check is a manual approval check on an environment, which would ensure that deployment to that environment only happens after the designated user(s) has reviewed the changes being deployed.






4
Azure Pipelines
A stage can consist of many jobs, and each job can consume several resources. Before the execution of a stage can begin, all checks on all the resources used in that stage must be satisfied. Azure Pipelines pauses the execution of a pipeline prior to each stage, and waits for all pending checks to be completed. 




5
Azure Pipelines
Approvals and other checks aren't defined in the yaml file. Users modifying the pipeline yaml file can't modify the checks performed before start of a stage. Administrators of resources manage checks using the web interface of Azure Pipelines.

In private equity, funds and investors seek out underperforming or undervalued companies that they can take private and turn around, before going public years later. Buyout firms are involved in management buyouts (MBOs), in which the management of the company being purchased takes a stake. They often play key roles in leveraged buyouts, which are buyouts that are funded with borrowed money.

The common flow of activity looks like this:

Bring data into Power BI Desktop, and create a report.
Publish to the Power BI service, where you can create new visualizations or build dashboards.
Share dashboards with others, especially people who are on the go.
View and interact with shared dashboards and reports in Power BI Mobile apps.

An important and enabling part of Power BI is the multitude of data connectors that are included. Whether the data you want is in Excel or a Microsoft SQL Server database, in Azure or Oracle, or in a service like Facebook, Salesforce, or MailChimp, Power BI has built-in data connectors that let you easily connect to that data, filter it if necessary, and bring it into your dataset.

When you're creating a dashboard in Power BI, you can move or arrange tiles however you want. You can make them bigger, change their height or width, and snuggle them up to other tiles.

When you're viewing, or consuming, a dashboard or report—which means you're not the creator or owner, but the report or dashboard has been shared with you—you can interact with it, but you can't change the size of the tiles or their arrangement.

An app is a collection of preset, ready-made visuals and reports that are shared with an entire organization. Using an app is like microwaving a TV dinner or ordering a fast-food value meal: you just have to press a few buttons or make a few comments, and you're quickly served a collection of entrees designed to go together, all presented in a tidy, ready-to-consume package.

Your Excel files might exist in one of the following locations:
Local - You can import data from a local file into Power BI. The file isn't moved into Power BI, and a link doesn't remain to it. Instead, a new dataset is created in Power BI, and data from the Excel file is loaded into it. Accordingly, changes to the original Excel file aren't reflected in your Power BI dataset. You can use local data import for data that doesn't change.

Your Excel files might exist in one of the following locations:
OneDrive for Business - You can pull data from OneDrive for Business into Power BI. This method is effective in keeping an Excel file and your dataset, reports, and dashboards in Power BI synchronized. Power BI connects regularly to your file on OneDrive. If any changes are found, your dataset, reports, and dashboards are automatically updated in Power BI.

Your Excel files might exist in one of the following locations:
OneDrive - Personal - You can use data from files on a personal OneDrive account, and get many of the same benefits that you would with OneDrive for Business. However, you'll need to sign in with your personal OneDrive account, and select the Keep me signed in option. Check with your system administrator to determine whether this type of connection is allowed in your organization.

Your Excel files might exist in one of the following locations:
SharePoint - Team Sites - Saving your Power BI Desktop files to SharePoint Team Sites is similar to saving to OneDrive for Business. The main difference is how you connect to the file from Power BI. You can specify a URL or connect to the root folder.

Authentication method(s) for SQL Server databases in Power BI:
Microsoft account - Use your Microsoft account credentials. This option is often used for Azure services.

Authentication method(s) for SQL Server databases in Power BI:
Database - Use your database credentials. For instance, SQL Server has its own sign-in and authentication system that is sometimes used. If the database administrator gave you a unique sign-in to the database, you might need to enter those credentials on the Database tab.

After the database has been connected to Power BI Desktop, the Navigator window displays the data that is available in your data source (the SQL database in this example). You can select a table or entity to preview its contents and make sure that the correct data will be loaded into the Power BI model.

On the Home tab, select Transform data, and then select the Data source settings option.

From the list of data sources that displays, select the data source that you want to update. Then, you can right-click that data source to view the available update options or you can use the update option buttons on the lower left of the window. Select the update option that you need, change the settings as required, and then apply your changes.

When using an SQL query to import data, try to avoid using the wildcard character (*) in your query. If you use the wildcard character in your select statement, you import all columns from the specified table.

SQL
SELECT * FROM SALES

The wildcard character (*) will import all characters from within the Sales table. This method isn't recommended because it will lead to redundant data in your model, which will cause performance issues and require extra steps to normalize your data for reporting.

It's a best practice to avoid writing SQL queries directly in Power BI. Instead, consider writing a query like this in a view. A view is an object in a relational database, similar to a table. Views have rows and columns, and can contain almost every operator in the SQL language. If Power BI uses a view, when it retrieves data, it participates in query folding, a feature of Power Query.

You can use parameters by determining the values that you want to see data for in the report, and the report updates accordingly by filtering the data for you.

Creating dynamic reports allows you to give users more power over the data that is displayed in your reports; they can change the data source and filter the data by themselves.
