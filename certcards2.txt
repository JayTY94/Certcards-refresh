To round a float to two decimal places within a Python f-string, you use the format specifier .2f. The .2 indicates the precision, which is the number of decimal places, and the f is the presentation type for fixed-point number, which displays the number as a float:

>>> f"One third, rounded to two decimal places is: {1 / 3:.2f}"
'One third, rounded to two decimal places is: 0.33'

Decide on a tier and region. One free search service is allowed per subscription. All quickstarts can be completed on the free tier. For more capacity and capabilities, you'll need a billable tier.
Create a search service in the Azure portal.
Start with Import data wizard. Choose a built-in sample or a supported data source to create, load, and query an index in minutes.
Finish with Search Explorer, using a portal client to query the search index you just created.

Python
In Python, a sequence is a category of data types that has certain characteristics and supports specific operations.





827
Python
Python sequences have three common characteristics:

  They are iterable, which means you can iterate through them.
  They have a length, which means you can pass them to len() to get the number of elements it contains.
  An element of a sequence can be accessed based on its position in the sequence using an integer index.






827
Python
In Python, you generally can’t concatenate sequences of different types. If you try to add a list and a tuple, Python raises a TypeError:

>>> [1, 2, 3] + (4, 5, 6)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: can only concatenate list (not "tuple") to list





827
Python
In Python, you can compare sequences of the same type. When comparing two sequences, the first 
non-equal
 value determines the outcome.

For example, consider the following lists:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
more_numbers = [1, 2, 2, 10, 20]
When you compare these lists, you’ll find that numbers is greater than more_numbers.





827
Python
To make a class indexable in Python, you can add the 
.__getitem__()
 special method to the class. This method should accept 
an index
 and return the item at that position.





827
Python
A sized object in Python is an object that has a defined length. You can access this length using the built-in len() function.

You can make an object sized by adding the .__len__() special method to the class definition. This method must return an integer.





827
Python
To make a class iterable, you need to define the .__iter__() special method in the class. This method must return an iterator, which Python uses in its iteration protocol.





827
Python
When you try to create an instance of a class that inherits from the Sequence abstract base class, but doesn’t implement .__getitem__() and .__len__(), then Python raises a TypeError:

The Sequence abstract base class requires that any class that inherits from it must implement the .__getitem__() and .__len__() methods.





827
Python
In Python, an immutable sequence is one that you can’t change once it’s been created. Immutable built-in sequences include tuples and strings.

Remember that the initialization function in a class is named __init__() with 2 underscores before and after the word init. I tried to declare a class with 3 once, and it was embarrassing.




827
Python
When declaring a function, follow arguments with a colon and the desired type to designate a required type for that argument. For example

def get_engagement_names(schedules: pd.DataFrame):
    engagement_names = [
        ' - '.join(row[['Account Name', 'EngagementName', 'Engagement Number']])
        for _, row in schedules.iterrows()

    engagement_names = "\n".join(engagement_names)
    return engagement_names

The purpose of the Data Privacy Firewall is simple: it exists to prevent Power Query from unintentionally leaking data between sources.







827
Power BI
Formula.Firewall errors are the result of Power Query's Data Privacy Firewall (also known as the Firewall), which at times may seem like it exists solely to frustrate data analysts the world over. 





827
Power BI
A huge part of Power Query's power comes from the fact that PQ can convert the operations a user performs via its user interface into complex SQL or other backend data source languages, without the user having to know said languages. Users get the performance benefit of native data source operations, with the ease of use of a UI where all data sources can be transformed using a common set of commands.







827
Power BI
At its most basic level, a partition is just a collection of one or more query steps. The most granular partition possible (at least in the current implementation) is a single step. The largest partitions can sometimes encompass multiple queries.





827
Power BI
When a query is evaluated with the Firewall on, the Firewall divides the query and all its dependencies into partitions (that is, groups of steps). Anytime one partition references something in another partition, the Firewall replaces the reference with a call to a special function called Value.Firewall.

In order for your single-partition-but-two-data-sources query to be allowed to run, its two data sources must be "compatible". In other words, it needs to be okay for data to be shared bidirectionally between them. This means that the privacy levels of both sources need to be Public, or both be Organizational, since these are the only two combinations that allow sharing in both directions.

If there are data sources being accessed within the partition, and data flowing in from other partitions, the Firewall loses its ability to be the gatekeeper, since the data flowing in could be leaked to one of the internally accessed data sources without it knowing about it. Thus the Firewall prevents a partition that accesses other partitions from being allowed to directly access any data sources.

With Query Diagnostics, you can achieve a better understanding of what Power Query is doing at authoring and at refresh time in Power BI Desktop. At this time you can use it to understand what sort of queries you're emitting, what slowdowns you might run into during authoring refresh, and what kind of background events are happening.

Returns a single value: The SELECTEDVALUE function returns the value of an expression evaluated in the context of a single cell. It is commonly used in scenarios where you expect only one value to be present in the current context, such as when filtering a column in a visual or when using a slicer.

Error handling: If there are multiple values or if the context is ambiguous (e.g., no filter applied, multiple selections), SELECTEDVALUE will return an error by default. To handle this situation, you can provide an optional second argument to specify a default value to return if SELECTEDVALUE encounters an error. This allows you to gracefully handle scenarios where the expected condition is not met.
