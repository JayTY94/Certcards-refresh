Most of the DR relationship building doesn’t occur when an event happens, it occurs prior to the security event. Often years before a security event would occur. There’s ongoing communication and meetings to make sure that everyone is involved in the process. And if you do have a security exercise, it’s important to involve all of your stakeholders.

When setting a Deadline or a Postpone date for an Orchestrator transaction, we recommend populating the respective fields with relative dates. For example, DateTime.Now.AddHours(2), DateTime.Now.AddDays(10) and DateTime.Now.Add(New System.TimeSpan(5, 0, 0, 0)). Additionally, you can use the US notation to add an exact time, such as 10/10/2019 07:40:00. Automatic correction of this date is available, for example, if you write 12 10 2019 9:0, it is automatically transformed to 12/10/2019 09:00:00.

A postern is a secondary door or gate in a fortification such as a city wall or castle curtain wall. Posterns were often located in a concealed location which allowed the occupants to come and go inconspicuously. In the event of a siege, a postern could act as a sally port, allowing defenders to make a sortie on the besiegers.

Once the power goes out, there’s usually a 10- or 15-second waiting period to see if the power happens to turn back on. And if it does not, the generator turns on and begins providing power to the building. During that 10 or 15 seconds, though, you will need some type of internal power in the building to make sure that all of your systems remain up and running, which is why you might combine both the UPS and the generator power.

It’s important that the application developer understand exactly what input is being used, and how that input is being handled by the application. The attackers are going to use third party tools, such as fuzzers, to be able to constantly try to randomize input into the application to see if perhaps they can make the application perform unexpectedly or in a way that they could replicate later on.

Thomas Andrew Lehrer (/ˈlɛərər/; born April 9, 1928) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, satirist, and mathematician. He recorded pithy and humorous songs that became popular in the 1950s and 1960s. His songs often parodied popular musical forms, though they usually had original melodies. An exception is "The Elements", in which he set the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the "Major-General's Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance.

Code Signing is similar to the process we use to provide encryption certificates on web servers. We first need a trusted certificate authority who’s going to sign the developer’s public key. The developer will then use their private key to digitally sign any code that they happen to be deploying. That means that you can validate that this code is exactly what was deployed by the original developer, by validating it with their public key.
