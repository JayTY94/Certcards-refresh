The .__repr__() method is designed to provide a string representation of an object that is useful for developers. The goal is to create a string that you can use to reconstruct an identical object.

This is particularly useful for debugging and logging, as it provides a clear and unambiguous description of the object.





12
Python
F-strings are evaluated at runtime, meaning that the expressions inside the curly braces are inserted when the code that defines the string runs.

Azure Functions
Because of the extra features that are included with Azure Functions, including wider ranges of trigger events and supported languages, the ability to develop test code in the browser, and the pay-per-use price model, consider Azure Functions to be your default choice. There are a few situations in which WebJobs might be a better choice:

You have an existing Azure App Service application, and you want to model the workflow within the application.

Python
In Python, if the left-hand operand doesn’t support an operator, then Python calls the right-hand version of the operator method, which is prefixed with __r.

For example, the right-hand version of .__add__() is .__radd__(). This allows the right-hand operand to handle the operation.

An Administrative user is a user who has access to the Settings and Administration features but has no access to any of the functionality.

The modulo operator (%) is the oldest tool for performing string interpolation in Python. Even though you can use this operator for both eager and lazy string interpolation, the syntax could be more readable and clean.

You need to insert conversion specifiers into your strings and then use the modulo operator to interpolate the desired values:

>>> x = 5
>>> y = 10
>>> "The sum of %d and %d is %d." % (x, y, x + y)
'The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.'

Why is my storage consumption decreasing in database and growing in file?
We are constantly optimizing the Dataverse for ease of use, performance, and efficiency. Part of this ongoing effort is to move data to the best possible storage with the lowest cost for customers. File-type data such as “Annotation” and “Attachment” is moving from database to file storage. This leads to decreased usage of database capacity and an increase in file capacity.

Python
In pandas, you have several methods at your disposal for data aggregation:

.pivot_table() is great for creating pivot tables that summarize data.
.groupby() is used to group data according to the values in one or more columns.
crosstab() is used to compute a cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors.

I had to use the os.path abspath function to get the absolute path of the file I created for the sake of sending it as an email attachment.
  from os.path import abspath

Grids: Grids are tabular representations of data within a model-driven app in Power Apps. They allow users to view and interact with rows of data from a table. Grids can be configured to show specific columns and can be customized to include features like sorting, filtering, and pagination.

To successfully connect to your Dataverse, you must first register an app with Entra ID, which you can complete in the Azure portal. Depending on the type of app that you want to make, a few different settings are available for you to configure (web apps versus native apps that are installed natively on a device). For more information on settings required for each type, see Types of app registration.

Python sequences have three common characteristics:

  They are iterable, which means you can iterate through them.
  They have a length, which means you can pass them to len() to get the number of elements it contains.
  An element of a sequence can be accessed based on its position in the sequence using an integer index.

3. You have a table that stores account balance snapshots for each date, excluding weekends. You need to ensure that your measure formula only filters by a single date. Also, if no record is on the last date of a time period, it should use the latest account balance. Which DAX time intelligence function should you use? 

The LASTNONBLANK function will return the last date in the filter context where a snapshot record exists. This option will help you achieve the objective.

Power BI
Multiple requests to the same data source can occur if multiple queries pull from that data source. These requests can happen even in a case where only one query references the data source. If that query is referenced by one or more other queries, then each query—along with all the queries it depends on—is evaluated independently.

MS Dataverse
As described in Use messages with the SDK for .NET, data operations in the Dataverse platform are based on messages and every message has a name. There are Create, Retrieve, RetrieveMultiple, Update, Delete, Associate and Disassociate messages that cover the basic data operations that happen with tables.

Storage mode: With storage mode, you can now specify which visuals require a query to back-end data sources. Visuals that don't require a query are imported even if they're based on DirectQuery. This feature helps improve performance and reduce back-end load. Previously, even simple visuals, such as slicers, initiated queries that were sent to back-end sources.

By default, PyTorch uses eager mode computation. You can run a neural net as you build it, line by line, which makes it easier to debug. It also makes it possible to construct neural nets with conditional execution. This dynamic execution is more intuitive for most Python programmers.

HTTP triggers let you use API keys to block unknown callers by requiring a key as part of the request. When you create a function, you select the authorization level. By default, it's set to Function, which requires a function-specific API key. It can also be set to Admin to use a global "master" key, or Anonymous to indicate that no key is required. You can also change the authorization level through the function properties after creation.

A build contains one or more jobs. Most jobs run on an agent. A job represents an execution boundary of a set of steps. All the steps run together on the same agent.

3. Using type hints with dynamic or complex types
Sometimes the type of a variable might not be straightforward, such as when it can be one of several types or when the type is not known until runtime. Python's typing module provides tools to handle these cases:

Union: When a value can be one of multiple types.

from typing import Union

def get_length(item: Union[str, list]) -> int:
    return len(item)

The modulo operator (%) came to make the syntax a bit better:

>>> "Hello, %s! Today is %s." % (name, day)
'Hello, Pythonista! Today is Friday.'

In this example, you use the modulo operator to insert the name and day variables into the string literals. The process of creating strings by inserting other strings into them, as you did here, is known as string interpolation.

Adding an equal sign after a variable or expression in an f-string creates a self-documenting expression. This feature is particularly useful for debugging because it not only shows the result of the expression but also the expression itself, making what is being evaluated clear. For example, print(f"{value = }") would output value = Suspicious value, showing both the variable name and its value.

Augmented assignment operators provide a more concise way to update the value of a variable. For example, counter += 1 is a shorthand for counter = counter + 1.

These operators rely on special methods like .__iadd__() for in-place operations. If the data type is mutable, then Python performs the operation in place. If the data type is immutable, Python returns a new object with the updated value.

Before you can publish your Functions project to Azure, you must have a function app and related resources in your Azure subscription to run your code.

Python
In Python, you can compare sequences of the same type. When comparing two sequences, the first 
non-equal
 value determines the outcome.

For example, consider the following lists:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
more_numbers = [1, 2, 2, 10, 20]
When you compare these lists, you’ll find that numbers is greater than more_numbers.
