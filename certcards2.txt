Python
String interpolation allows you to create strings by inserting objects into specific places in a target string template. Python has several tools for string interpolation, including f-strings, the str.format() method, and the modulo operator (%). Python’s string module also provides the Template class, which you can use for string interpolation.





19
Python
When you use the .safe_substitute() method from the Template class with a dictionary that doesn’t match all placeholders, it returns the string with the missing placeholders shown as is. This method doesn’t raise a KeyError like the .format() method does when faced with missing keys.

Function runtime	Azure Functions currently supports several versions of the runtime host. Functions also support many different runtimes such as .NET Core, Node.js, Java, PowerShell and Python.

Get-Service | Format-List
This command formats information about services on the computer as a list. By default, the services are formatted as a table. The Get-Service cmdlet gets objects representing the services on the computer. The pipeline operator (|) passes the results through the pipeline to Format-List. Then, the Format-List command formats the service information in a list and sends it to the default output cmdlet for display.

Python supports augmented assignment operators for both arithmetic and bitwise operations. For example, &=, |=, and ^= are augmented bitwise operators that rely on methods such as .__iand__(), .__ior__(), and .__ixor__().

When you create a function app, it must be linked to a storage account. You can select an existing account or create a new one. The function app uses this storage account for internal operations, such as logging function executions and managing execution triggers. On the consumption plan, this storage account is also where the function code and configuration files are stored.

Usage metrics reports are a feature that the Power BI or global administrator can turn on or off.

You can also use dictionaries and named replacement fields:

>>> jane = {"name": "Jane", "job": "Python Dev"}

>>> "My name is %(name)s. I'm a %(job)s." % jane
"My name is Jane. I'm a Python Dev."

In this example, the modulo operator inserts each value using the corresponding key, which is way more readable and intuitive. To build the named replacement fields, you need to insert the name in parentheses between the % sign and the format specifier.

The modulo operator (%) is the oldest tool for performing string interpolation in Python. Even though you can use this operator for both eager and lazy string interpolation, the syntax could be more readable and clean.

You need to insert conversion specifiers into your strings and then use the modulo operator to interpolate the desired values:

>>> x = 5
>>> y = 10
>>> "The sum of %d and %d is %d." % (x, y, x + y)
'The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.'

HTTP triggers let you use API keys to block unknown callers by requiring a key as part of the request. When you create a function, you select the authorization level. By default, it's set to Function, which requires a function-specific API key. It can also be set to Admin to use a global "master" key, or Anonymous to indicate that no key is required. You can also change the authorization level through the function properties after creation.

Functions are event driven. They run only in response to an event (called a "trigger"), such as receiving an HTTP request, or a message being added to a queue. You configure a trigger as part of the function definition. This approach simplifies your code by allowing you to declare where the data comes from (trigger/input binding) and where it goes (output binding). You don't need to write code to watch queues, blobs, hubs, and so on. You can focus purely on the business logic.

Sometimes the type of a variable might not be straightforward, such as when it can be one of several types or when the type is not known until runtime. Python's typing module provides tools to handle these cases:

Union: When a value can be one of multiple types.

from typing import Union

def get_length(item: Union[str, list]) -> int:
    return len(item)

If there are data sources being accessed within the partition, and data flowing in from other partitions, the Firewall loses its ability to be the gatekeeper, since the data flowing in could be leaked to one of the internally accessed data sources without it knowing about it. Thus the Firewall prevents a partition that accesses other partitions from being allowed to directly access any data sources.

Augmented assignment operators provide a more concise way to update the value of a variable. For example, counter += 1 is a shorthand for counter = counter + 1.

These operators rely on special methods like .__iadd__() for in-place operations. If the data type is mutable, then Python performs the operation in place. If the data type is immutable, Python returns a new object with the updated value.

In DAX, when you use SUMX or similar functions that iterate over a table, the context within which the function operates changes to the row context of that table. This means each row of the table becomes the current context for the calculation during each iteration of the function. Because of this row context, you don’t need to explicitly reference the table name when accessing its columns within the function.
