scan report created by a third-party. Which of the following would they
expect to see on this report?
The Answer: C. The version of web server software in use

 A member of the accounting team was out of the office for two weeks,
and an important financial transfer was delayed until they returned.
Which of the following would have prevented this delay?

A security analyst has identified a number of sessions from a single IP
address with a TTL equal to zero. One of the sessions has a destination of
the Internet firewall, and a session immediately after has a destination of
your DMZ server. Which of the following BEST describes this
log information?
he Answer: D. Someone is performing a traceroute to the DMZ server
A traceroute maps each hop by slowly incrementing the TTL (Time

receiving router drops the packet and sends an ICMP (Internet Control
Message Protocol) TTL Exceeded message back to the original station.
