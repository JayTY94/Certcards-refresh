Dataverse Plugins
The Plugin Execution Pipeline defines the sequence of events where plugins can be triggered in Dataverse. The primary stages include:

Pre-validation: Executes before the main system operation, allowing for early validation.
Pre-operation: Runs after the main operation is validated but before it's committed to the database.
Post-operation: Occurs after the main operation has been completed and committed. Understanding these stages is crucial for placing plugins at the appropriate point in the data processing workflow, ensuring optimal performance and data integrity.





11
Dataverse Plugins
Filtering Attributes are specific fields defined during the registration of a plugin that determine when the plugin should execute. For instance, a plugin might be set to trigger only when certain attributes of an entity are updated. By specifying these attributes, Dataverse optimizes performance by invoking the plugin only when relevant data changes occur, rather than on every update to the entity.





12
Dataverse Plugins
Plugins are custom business logic components that execute in response to specific events within Dataverse, such as record creation or updates. Written in .NET, plugins can enforce business rules, validate data, or integrate with external systems. They are registered against specific messages (like Create, Update) and entities, allowing for granular control over when and how custom logic is triggered within the Dataverse environment.





13
sklearn
LeaveOneOut: This cross-validation technique uses every single observation as its own test set, leaving all other points as the training set. While it provides precise model evaluation, it is computationally expensive, particularly for large datasets.





14
sklearn
TimeSeriesSplit: TimeSeriesSplit performs cross-validation on time series data, keeping temporal ordering intact by using only past data to predict future data in each fold. It’s designed for forecasting, where future information should not be included in training.





15
sklearn
Assuming that some data is Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) is making the assumption that all samples stem from the same generative process and that the generative process is assumed to have no memory of past generated samples.

Python
Many popular machine learning algorithms and datasets are built into TensorFlow and are ready to use. In addition to the built-in datasets, you can access Google Research Datasets or use Google’s Dataset Search to find even more.





20
Python
In Python, you can compare sequences of the same type. When comparing two sequences, the first 
non-equal
 value determines the outcome.

For example, consider the following lists:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
more_numbers = [1, 2, 2, 10, 20]
When you compare these lists, you’ll find that numbers is greater than more_numbers.





21
Python
Sessions are used to persist parameters across requests. For example, if you want to use the same authentication across multiple requests, then you can use a session:

import requests

TOKEN = "<YOUR_GITHUB_PA_TOKEN>"

with requests.Session() as session:
    session.auth = TokenAuth(TOKEN)

    first_response = session.get("https://api.github.com/user")
    second_response = session.get("https://api.github.com/user")

Azure Functions
Just like the other triggers we've seen so far, you can create a blob trigger in the Azure portal. Inside your Azure function, select Blob trigger from the list of predefined trigger types. Then, enter the logic that you want to execute when a blob is created or updated.

One setting that's important to understand is the Path. The Path tells the blob trigger which blob container to monitor to see if a blob is uploaded or updated. By default, the Path value is:

samples-workitems/{name}





43
Azure Functions
A binding expression is specialized text in function.json, function parameters, or code that is evaluated when the function is invoked, to yield a value. For example, if you have a Service Bus Queue binding, you could use a binding expression to obtain the name of the queue from App Settings.





44
Azure Functions
Every Azure Function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to use multiple triggers, you must create multiple functions.

MS Identity Platform
Authorization server - The Microsoft identity platform is the authorization server. Also called an identity provider or IdP, it securely handles the end-user's information, their access, and the trust relationships between the parties in the auth flow. The authorization server issues the security tokens your apps and APIs use for granting, denying, or revoking access to resources (authorization) after the user has signed in (authenticated).





79
MS Identity Platform
The parties in an authentication flow use bearer tokens to assure, verify, and authenticate a principal (user, host, or service) and to grant or deny access to protected resources (authorization). Bearer tokens in the Microsoft identity platform are formatted as JSON Web Tokens (JWT).





80
MS Identity Platform
OAuth versus OpenID Connect: The platform uses OAuth for authorization and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0, so the terminology and flow are similar between the two. You can even both authenticate a user (through OpenID Connect) and get authorization to access a protected resource that the user owns (through OAuth 2.0) in one request.

Diffusers Library
Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
These equations describe how noise evolves over continuous time in diffusion models. By defining the noise dynamics, SDEs allow for modeling both forward (adding noise) and reverse (removing noise) processes as smooth, differential transformations.





82
Diffusers Library
Forward and Reverse Processes
In diffusion, the forward process gradually adds noise to data, following a fixed probabilistic schedule, and the reverse process learns to denoise the noisy data. Mathematically, the forward process models q(x_t | x_{t-1}), while the reverse learns p(x_{t-1} | x_t) to reconstruct images.

Dataverse Plugins
API Permissions and Scopes define what operations an application can perform and what data it can access within an API like Dataverse Web API. During Azure AD application registration, permissions are granted (e.g., user_impersonation) to control access levels. Scopes specify the exact permissions requested during the authentication process. Proper configuration ensures that applications have the necessary access without over-privileging, adhering to the principle of least privilege for security.





88
Dataverse Plugins
SDK Message Processing Steps represent the registration details of a plugin within Dataverse. Each step defines when (which message and stage) and how a plugin executes. Key properties include the message (e.g., Update), primary entity, execution pipeline stage (Pre-validation, Pre-operation, Post-operation), and filtering attributes. These steps orchestrate the plugin's behavior in response to data operations.





89
Dataverse Plugins
The PluginType entity in Dataverse stores metadata about registered plugins. It includes information such as the plugin's unique identifier (plugintypeid), name, assembly details, and the class implementing the plugin logic.

Resource owner - The resource owner in an auth flow is usually the application user, or end-user in OAuth terminology. The end-user "owns" the protected resource (their data) which your app accesses on their behalf. The resources owners can grant or deny your app (the client) access to the resources they own. For example, your app might call an external system's API to get a user's email address from their profile on that system.





216
Diffusers Library
Reverse Diffusion
The inverse process where an image is generated by removing noise, step-by-step, from an initial noisy state. This approach is essential in diffusion models, reconstructing data by "reversing" the diffusion process and achieving high-quality image outputs.





217
Diffusers Library
Markov Chain
A sequence of random variables where each state depends only on the previous one. In diffusion models, the noise addition process is modeled as a Markov chain, allowing controlled transitions from clear images to noisy ones and vice versa, simplifying the math for training.





218
Diffusers Library
Likelihood Estimation
The process of calculating the probability of the data under the model's parameters. In diffusion models, maximizing this likelihood means finding parameters that make the observed data most probable, allowing for a better approximation of complex data distributions.





219
sklearn
When evaluating the resulting model it is important to do it on held-out samples that were not seen during the grid search process: it is recommended to split the data into a development set (to be fed to the GridSearchCV instance) and an evaluation set to compute performance metrics.





220
sklearn
The classes in sklearn.neighbors can handle either NumPy arrays or scipy.sparse matrices as input. For dense matrices, a large number of possible distance metrics are supported. For sparse matrices, arbitrary Minkowski metrics are supported for searches.





221
sklearn
Data leakage occurs when information from the test set inadvertently influences the model during training, leading to overly optimistic performance. Cross-validation methods that respect data structure, like LeavePGroupsOut or TimeSeriesSplit, help prevent this risk.

from sklearn import metrics
scores = cross_val_score(
    clf, X, y, cv=5, scoring='f1_macro')
scores
array([0.96..., 1.  ..., 0.96..., 0.96..., 1.        ])

Back: Port Mapping in Docker connects a port on the host machine to a port inside a Docker container. It allows external access to services running within containers. For example, mapping host port 80 to container port 80 enables users to access a web server running inside the container via the host's IP address on port 80.





241
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
The bridge network is the default configuration applied to containers when launched without specifying any other network configuration. This network is an internal, private network used by the container, and it isolates the container network from the Docker host network.





242
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A registry is organized as a series of repositories. Each repository contains multiple Docker images that share a common name and generally the same purpose and functionality. These images normally have different versions, identified with a tag. This mechanism enables you to publish and retain multiple versions of images for compatibility reasons.





243
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
For more advanced scenarios, both Linux and Windows provide additional network options. For example, the overlay option creates a virtual switch from the host network, so containers on that network can get IP addresses from DHCP servers or operate with IP addresses from that network segment. Furthermore, Docker allows third-party vendors to create network plugins.

An S Corporation is a type of corporation that meets specific Internal Revenue Code requirements. The main difference between an S Corp and a C Corp is how they are taxed. An S Corp is a pass-through entity, meaning that the corporation's income, deductions, and credits pass through to the shareholders, who report these on their personal tax returns.





263
Diffusers Library
Score Matching
A method to train models by estimating the gradient of data probability density (the "score") at each noise level. By approximating this gradient, the model learns to shift noisy data towards regions of higher probability, ultimately leading to denoised, realistic images.





264
Diffusers Library
There are three main components of the library to know about:
Many different schedulers - algorithms that control how noise is added for training, and how to generate denoised images during inference.





265

Python
In Python, special methods support comparison operators.

For example, the .__lt__() method supports the < operator, .__gt__() supports >, and the .__eq__() method supports the == operator.

These methods allow you to define custom behavior for comparison operations in your custom classes.





267
Python
When you make a request, the Requests library prepares the request before actually sending it to the destination server. Request preparation includes things like validating headers and serializing JSON content.

You can view the PreparedRequest object by accessing .request on a Response object:





268
Python
Because the decoding of bytes to a str requires an encoding scheme, Requests will try to guess the encoding based on the response’s headers if you don’t specify one. You can provide an explicit encoding by setting .encoding before accessing .text:

>>> response.encoding = "utf-8"  # Optional: Requests infers this.
>>> response.text
'{"current_user_url":"https://api.github.com/user", ...}'





269
PP365
I had a ticket with Lauren Kawamoto going back to 11/22/24 about her permissions in the sandbox. It turns out that she needed the "TS - Recur Engagement" role to recur engagements. I thought that "system administrator" would be enough, but I was not able to do that myself with the sysadmin role. Strange.





270
PP365
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
A security feature implemented in web browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. Configuring CORS in Azure Functions allows specific domains (e.g., Dynamics 365) to interact with the function securely.





271
PP365
System-Assigned Managed Identity

278
Azure Functions
You can use three durable function types: Client, Orchestrator, and Activity.
Client functions are the entry point for creating an instance of a Durable Functions orchestration. They can run in response to an event from many sources, such as a new HTTP request arriving, a message being posted to a message queue, an event arriving in an event stream. You can write them in any of the supported languages.





279
Azure Functions
Async HTTP APIs: This pattern addresses the problem of coordinating state of long-running operations with external clients. An HTTP call can trigger the long-running action, then redirect the client to a status endpoint. The client can learn when the operation is finished by polling this endpoint.





280
Azure Functions
2. Suppose your Azure Function has a blob trigger associated with it and you want it to execute only when png images are uploaded. Which of the following blob trigger Path values should you use? 

samples-workitems/{name}.png
The Path tells the blob trigger where it should monitor for changes, and if there are any filters applied. Adding a file extension to the Path specifies that uploaded files must have that file extension in order for the trigger to invoke the function.

It specifies the services, networks, and volumes needed for the application, allowing users to start and manage all containers with a single command (docker-compose up).





284
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
To place a container in the run state, use the run command. You can also restart a container that's already running. When restarting a container, the container receives a termination signal to enable any running processes to shut down gracefully before the container's kernel terminates.





285
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A volume is stored on the host filesystem at a specific folder location. Choose a folder where you know the data won't be modified by non-Docker processes.

Docker creates and manages the new volume by running the docker volume create command. This command can form part of our Dockerfile definition, which means that you can create volumes as part of the container-creation process. Docker creates the volume if it doesn't exist when you try to mount the volume into a container the first time.





286
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker containers provide security features to run multiple containers simultaneously on the same host without affecting each other. As we learned, we can configure both data storage and network configuration to isolate our containers or share data and connectivity between specific containers.

Front: Explain the difference between a Docker Image and a Docker Container.

Back:
Docker Image: A read-only template that contains the application and all its dependencies required to run it. Images are built from Dockerfiles and serve as the blueprint for containers.
Docker Container: A runnable instance of a Docker image. Containers are created from images and can be started, stopped, moved, and deleted independently.

Docker login will prompt you for a username and password. To find this information, go to the Azure portal and look up the access keys for the registry or run the following command.

Azure CLI
az acr credential show --name myregistry --resource-group mygroup

You push an image from your local computer to a Docker registry by using the docker push command. Before you push an image, you must create an alias for the image that specifies the repository and tag that the Docker registry creates. The repository name must be of the form *<login_server>/<image_name>:<tag/>. Use the docker tag command to perform this operation.

Front: What is Network Latency and how can it affect network performance?

Back: Network Latency refers to the time it takes for data to travel from the source to the destination across a network. High latency can result in delays, slow application performance, lag in real-time communications, and poor user experiences, especially in activities like gaming, video conferencing, and streaming.

Front: Explain the purpose of AllowedIPs in WireGuard configuration.

Back: AllowedIPs defines the IP addresses that are permitted to be routed through the VPN tunnel for a specific peer. It acts as both an access control list and routing rule, determining which traffic should be encrypted and sent through the VPN and which should bypass it.

The -f flag indicates the name of the Dockerfile to use.
The -t flag specifies the name of the image to be created; in this example, myapp:v1.
The final parameter, ., provides the build context for the source files for the COPY command: the set of files on the host computer needed during the build process.

Front: How does Pi-hole utilize DNS Sinkholing to block ads?

Back: Pi-hole intercepts DNS queries for domains listed in its blocklists. Instead of resolving these domains to their legitimate IP addresses, Pi-hole returns a non-routable IP address (e.g., 0.0.0.0), preventing the ad content from loading on the client devices.

The following example creates an alias for the reservationsystem image.

Bash
docker tag reservationsystem myregistry.azurecr.io/reservationsystem:v2

If you run docker image ls, you'll see two entries for the image: one with the original name and the second with the new alias.
