JS to speed up video playback if the player does not have a control for it
you could open the browser console (ctrl+shift+i), click on console. Then execute following

	document.querySelector('video').playbackRate = 1.5

works like a charm for me.

		○ The Automation COE leads can also sometimes coincide with the Task Mining Admin




26
UiPath Task Mining
Throughout a Task Mining project, some other roles might get involved to support during some stages of the process.

Before starting the recording process, instruct users on a few best practices to take into consideration while they are performing their tasks:

	Have all the users consistently record for the defined period of time
		This will avoid having one user recording a significantly larger amount of data and skew the results



30
UiPath Task Mining
Before starting the recording process, instruct users on a few best practices to take into consideration while they are performing their tasks:

The Task Mining admin console automatically creates a dataset under the Datasets section in the AI Center project we created and linked with our Task Mining project



2
UiPath Task Mining
If the Admin chose the Continuous option in the Output Configuration section of the Task Mining project, the data captured was automatically pushed as a dataset in AI Center. If the Admin chose 'Via shared drive', they will have to explicitly push the recorded data from the network location to the AI Center project



3
UiPath Task Mining
Then, the easiest option is to run the out-of-the-box ML model for Task Mining from AI Center. To do this:
	Select the UiPath Task Mining package under the ML Packages section in the AI Center project. Select the Model version, hit Submit, then enter the Package Name and the Description. Finally, hit Submit.
	Select the Evaluation run pipeline for the out-of-the-box Task Mining model and pass the dataset created by Task Mining console



4
UiPath Task Mining
The ML model run will take between few hours and two days based on the size of the dataset

Once the model completes the execution, the results will be automatically uploaded to the Task Mining project, under Discovery results.
