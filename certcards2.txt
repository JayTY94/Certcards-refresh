A postern is a secondary door or gate in a fortification such as a city wall or castle curtain wall. Posterns were often located in a concealed location which allowed the occupants to come and go inconspicuously. In the event of a siege, a postern could act as a sally port, allowing defenders to make a sortie on the besiegers.

Once the power goes out, there’s usually a 10- or 15-second waiting period to see if the power happens to turn back on. And if it does not, the generator turns on and begins providing power to the building. During that 10 or 15 seconds, though, you will need some type of internal power in the building to make sure that all of your systems remain up and running, which is why you might combine both the UPS and the generator power.

It’s important that the application developer understand exactly what input is being used, and how that input is being handled by the application. The attackers are going to use third party tools, such as fuzzers, to be able to constantly try to randomize input into the application to see if perhaps they can make the application perform unexpectedly or in a way that they could replicate later on.

Thomas Andrew Lehrer (/ˈlɛərər/; born April 9, 1928) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, satirist, and mathematician. He recorded pithy and humorous songs that became popular in the 1950s and 1960s. His songs often parodied popular musical forms, though they usually had original melodies. An exception is "The Elements", in which he set the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the "Major-General's Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance.

Many of our managed switches can be used to control broadcasts. There’s functionality within the software of the switch itself that allows us to limit the number of broadcasts that can be sent in any particular second. Some of these switches can even provide control of multicast, and unicast as well.

Code Signing is similar to the process we use to provide encryption certificates on web servers. We first need a trusted certificate authority who’s going to sign the developer’s public key. The developer will then use their private key to digitally sign any code that they happen to be deploying. That means that you can validate that this code is exactly what was deployed by the original developer, by validating it with their public key.

Horizontal Privilege Escalation
Horizontal privilege escalation means that a user will achieve access permissions belonging to another user that owns the same access level as the user that has started the cyberattack. It is a bit more challenging compared to vertical ones since they require a deep understanding of how operating systems work.

An IT department doesn’t commonly operate in a vacuum. There are usually customers of IT that have applications, data, and other technical resources that the IT department is managing for them. These are the stakeholders in your organization, and when something is not working properly, it’s the stakeholders that are going to be suffering.
