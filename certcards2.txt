When you create your DLP policies, you should consider rolling them out gradually, so you can assess their impact and test their effectiveness before fully enforcing them. For example, you don't want a new DLP policy to unintentionally block access to thousands of documents or to break an existing business process.





107
Microsoft Purview
DLP reports a vast amount of information to Microsoft Purview from monitoring policy matches and actions, to user activities. You need to consume and act on that information to tune your policies and triage actions taken on sensitive items. The telemetry goes into the Microsoft 365 audit Logs first, is processed, and makes its way to different reporting tools.

Power BI
Q: In a Pro workspace, which Service-side feature that profiles per-table/partition timings is unavailable?
A: The Query Inspector (Query performance pane) in the Power BI Service is only available on Premium or Premium Per User. Pro users only see basic Refresh History.





143
Power BI
Q: How can using the “Enable Load of Related Entities” option in the Dataverse connector improve performance?
    A:

    This option, in the Dataverse (OData) connector, fetches related lookup or option‐set tables alongside the main entity in one API call.

    Reduces the number of round trips, preserves folding, and can significantly cut down on refresh time compared to separately querying each related table.





144
Power BI
Q: Why might using a Date dimension table improve model performance and simplify filters?
    A:

    A dedicated Date table lets you create one‐to‐many relationships to fact tables and use date‐intelligence DAX functions efficiently.

    It centralizes filters (e.g., Year, Quarter) rather than filtering on a date column in every fact, reducing the complexity of DAX queries that run during refresh or visual rendering.





145
Power BI
How does ALLEXCEPT work in a measure?
ALLEXCEPT(table, column1, …) removes all filters on the specified table except those on the listed columns. It’s used inside CALCULATE to preserve only certain filters (for example, keep EngagementID but ignore Task Category).





146
Power BI
Q: How can Aggregations in Power BI speed up queries on large fact tables?
    A:

    Define a summarized (aggregated) table at a higher grain (e.g., daily sales totals) and point visuals to it for common queries.

    The engine stores both the detailed and aggregated tables; for queries that can be satisfied by the aggregate, Power BI never scans the full fact table, reducing query time dramatically.





147
Power BI
Q: What indicates a break in query folding when reviewing Query Diagnostics in Power Query?
A: In the “Folding” diagnostic table, any step marked “Not foldable” shows where folding stopped, meaning subsequent transformations happen client‐side.





148
Power BI
What’s the difference between SUMMARIZE and SUMMARIZECOLUMNS?
SUMMARIZE creates a virtual table using a row context that you must convert to filter context with CALCULATE, whereas SUMMARIZECOLUMNS works directly in filter context, handles aggregations and filter modifiers more predictably, and is optimized by the engine for better performance.





149
Power BI
Q: What is the default command timeout for the SQL Server connector in Power Query?
A: 10 minutes. Queries taking longer will time out unless you explicitly increase the CommandTimeout in the M step.





150
Power BI
Q: What is the typical Power BI Service behavior when you define an Incremental Refresh policy but deploy to a Pro workspace?
A: The service ignores the policy and performs a full‐table refresh each time, without partitioning.





151
Power BI
Q: How do you use Performance Analyzer in Power BI Desktop?
A: In Report view, go to View → Performance Analyzer → Start Recording → Refresh Visuals. It shows DAX query times, visual rendering times, etc., for each visual.





152
Power BI
What’s the scope of variables (VAR) inside an ADDCOLUMNS column definition?
A VAR declared inside one column’s definition lives only within that column. To share results, you must either repeat the logic or separate the columns into multiple ADDCOLUMNS calls so that the column values exist in the table.





153

A:
Successful execution without errors.





159
Python
Q:
How does using yield from affect the performance of a generator?

A:
yield from can improve performance by delegating part of the generator’s operations to another generator, reducing overhead and simplifying code.

Example:
def generator1():
    yield from range(1000)

def generator2():
    yield from generator1()

# More efficient delegation

163
Python
Q:
What is lazy evaluation, and how do generators implement it in Python?

A:
Lazy evaluation is a strategy where computations are deferred until their results are needed. Generators implement lazy evaluation by yielding one item at a time, generating each value only when requested.





164
Python
What is contextlib.ExitStack used for in context managers?

A:
To manage a dynamic number of context managers and ensure that all entered contexts are properly exited, even if exceptions occur.

Example:
from contextlib import ExitStack

with ExitStack() as stack:
    files = [stack.enter_context(open(f, 'r')) for f in ['file1.txt', 'file2.txt']]
    # Work with files





165
Python
Q:
What is the difference between yield and return in a generator function?

A:
yield produces a value and pauses the generator, allowing it to resume later, while return exits the function and optionally returns a value, terminating the generator.





166
Python
Q:
What parameter can be used with tqdm to set the initial position of the progress bar in multi-threaded applications?

A:
The position parameter.





167
Python
Q:
How do you handle multiple exceptions in a single except block?

A:
By specifying a tuple of exception types in the except clause.

Example:
try:
    # Code that may raise exceptions
    pass
except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")





168
Python
Q:
How can you raise an exception inside a generator from outside?

A:
Using the .throw(type, value=None, traceback=None) method.





169
Python
import time
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager 
def timer():
    start = time.time()
    try: yield
    finally:
        end = time.time()
        print(f"Elapsed time: {end - start} seconds")

# Usage
with timer():
    # Code block to measure
    time.sleep(2)
# Output: Elapsed time: 2.002 seconds

async def async_gen():
    for i in range(3):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        yield i

async def main():
    async for value in async_gen():
        print(value)

asyncio.run(main())





175
Python
What does the any() function do when used with a generator expression?

A:
It returns True if any element of the generator is True, otherwise False. It evaluates elements lazily and stops as soon as a True is found.

Example:
result = any(x > 10 for x in gen())





176
Python
Q:
Why should you prefer sys.exit() over exit() in production scripts?

A:
sys.exit() is more explicit and is the standard way to exit scripts, while exit() is intended for interactive shells and may not behave as expected in all environments.

Active Directory and Azure Files
NetBIOS Domain Name
The short (pre–DNS) name for a domain, often all caps (e.g., CORP). Still required for some AD integrations like Azure Files.





218
Active Directory and Azure Files
Kerberos Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)
A Kerberos ticket issued to a user when they log in. Used to request service tickets from the KDC.





219
Active Directory and Azure Files
Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
The directory service role in Windows Server that provides authentication, authorization, and directory lookups. Runs on domain controllers.





220
Active Directory and Azure Files
Port 445 (SMB over TCP)
Required for SMB traffic. Many ISPs block this outbound, so Azure Files is usually used over VPN or ExpressRoute with a private endpoint.





221
Active Directory and Azure Files
unicodePwd Attribute
The AD attribute that stores the password for a user or computer account. For Azure Files, this is set to the storage account’s Kerberos key (kerb1/kerb2).





222
Active Directory and Azure Files
Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD)
Allows a service to impersonate users only to specific services. Again, not core to Azure Files, but important context for how Kerberos is normally “tightly scoped.”





223
Active Directory and Azure Files
Azure Private Endpoint
A network interface in your VNet that maps a private IP to a PaaS resource. For Azure Files, it’s how on-prem clients connect securely without relying on public 445.





224
Active Directory and Azure Files
Duplicate SPN
A misconfiguration where two AD objects both claim the same SPN. Kerberos can’t decide which to use, so authentication fails.





225
Active Directory and Azure Files
NTLM Authentication
Older, fallback authentication method. If Kerberos fails (e.g., due to missing SPN), clients may try NTLM. Azure Files AD integration doesn’t support NTLM, so SPNs and Kerberos are required.





226
Active Directory and Azure Files
Security Identifier (SID)
A unique, immutable identifier for an AD object. Used internally by Windows for access control. You’ll need the SID of the Azure Files computer account for Terraform.





227
Active Directory and Azure Files
Kerberos Service Ticket
A ticket issued by the KDC for a specific SPN (e.g., cifs/storageacct.file.core.windows.net). Encrypted with the Kerberos key stored in AD.





228
Active Directory and Azure Files
Service Principal Name (SPN)
An attribute on an AD object that maps a service instance to that account. For Azure Files, the SPN is:
cifs/<storageaccount>.file.core.windows.net





229
Active Directory and Azure Files
Computer Account
An AD object that represents a machine. Azure Files uses a pre-staged computer account to act as its “identity” for Kerberos.





230
Azure Functions + PP365
Local Debugging
Running and testing Azure Functions on a local machine to identify and fix issues before deployment. Python developers use tools like Azure Functions Core Tools and VS Code to debug functions locally, allowing for rapid development and troubleshooting in a controlled environment.





231
Azure Files Documentation
The procedures for changing the size, cost, and performance characteristics for Azure File Shares are different for classic file shares, which use the Microsoft.Storage resource provider, versus file shares created with Microsoft.FileShares (preview).





232
Azure Files Documentation
To register your storage account with AD DS, you create a computer account (or service logon account) representing it in your AD DS. Think of this process as if it were like creating an account representing an on-premises Windows file server in your AD DS.





233
Azure Files Documentation
The access tier of the file share dictates to the ratio of storage to IOPS/throughput costs (in the form of transactions). There are three access tiers: transaction optimized, hot, and cool. Changing the tier of the Azure file share results in transaction costs for the movement to the new access tier.





234
Azure Files Documentation
For Microsoft Entra Domain Services authentication, you must enable Microsoft Entra Domain Services and domain-join the VMs you plan to access file data from. Your domain-joined VM must reside in the same VNET as your Microsoft Entra Domain Services hosted domain.





235
Azure Files Documentation
On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

AD DS is commonly adopted by enterprises in on-premises environments or on cloud-hosted VMs, and AD DS credentials are used for access control. For more information, see Active Directory Domain Services Overview.





236
Azure Files Documentation
Kerberos authentication is available with Active Directory using AES 256 encryption (recommended) and RC4-HMAC. AES 128 Kerberos encryption isn't yet supported.





237
Azure Files Documentation
Hybrid identities

Hybrid user identities are identities in AD DS that are synced to Microsoft Entra ID using either the on-premises Microsoft Entra Connect Sync application or Microsoft Entra Connect cloud sync, a lightweight agent that can be installed from the Microsoft Entra Admin Center.





238
Azure Files Documentation
The amount of storage, IOPS, and throughput you provision can be dynamically scaled up or down as your needs change. However, you can only decrease a provisioned quantity after 24 hours have elapsed since your last quantity increase.





239
Azure Files Documentation
By default access is limited to the Active Directory forest where the storage account is registered. Users from any domain in that forest can access the file share contents, provided they have the appropriate permissions.





240
Azure Files Documentation
To enable AD DS authentication over SMB for Azure file shares, you need to register your Azure storage account with your on-premises AD DS and then set the required domain properties on the storage account. To register your storage account with AD DS, you create a computer account (or service logon account) representing it in your AD DS.





241
Azure Files Documentation
If your OU containing the storage account's computer account enforces password expiration, you must update the password before the maximum password age to prevent authentication failures when accessing Azure file shares. See Update the password of your storage account identity in AD for details.

Azure File Sync enables you to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files transforming an on-premises (or cloud) Windows Server into a quick cache of your SMB Azure file share.





243
Azure Files Documentation
Azure File Sync enables you to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Azure File Sync transforms an on-premises (or cloud) Windows Server into a quick cache of your SMB Azure file share.





244
Azure Files Documentation
The Kerberos authentication client is implemented as a security support provider (SSP), and it can be accessed through the Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI). Initial user authentication is integrated with the Winlogon single sign-on architecture.





245
Azure Files Documentation
Use of different clients, SMB versions, firewall rules, ISPs, or IT policies can affect connectivity to Azure Files. Good news is AzFileDiagnostics isolates and examines each source of possible issues and in turn provides you with advice or workarounds to correct the problem.





246
Azure Files Documentation
In general, mounting a file share can be simply achieved on Windows using a standard “net use” command. When you create a share, the Azure Portal automatically generates a “net use” command and makes it available for copy and pasting: look for the "Connect" button.





247
Azure Files Documentation
Classic file shares, and the child objects for other storage services like blob containers, that live within the same storage account share a common pool of storage, IOPS, and throughput. This means placing multiple classic file shares in a storage account requires planning to avoid capacity bottlenecks





248
Azure Files Documentation
Using the storage account key to mount the Azure file share is effectively an administrator operation, because the mounted file share has full permissions to all of the files and folders on the share, even if they have ACLs. When using the storage account key to mount over SMB, the NTLMv2 authentication protocol is used.





249
Azure Files Documentation
NFS file shares rely on network-level authentication and are therefore only accessible via restricted networks. Using an NFS file share always requires some level of networking configuration.

Power BI
Why can’t you reference a newly added column alias in the same SUMMARIZECOLUMNS call?
DAX processes each expression in a single SUMMARIZECOLUMNS call in isolation, so the engine doesn’t know aliases until after all expressions are parsed. You must either inline the logic or add the column in a separate step.





421

Q: How can you increase the SQL connector’s command timeout in M?
A: In the Sql.Database(...) step, add CommandTimeout=#duration(0,0,20,0) (for 20 minutes), e.g.:

m
Source = Sql.Database("server", "db", [ Query="...", CommandTimeout=#duration(0,0,20,0) ])





422
Power BI
Q: If you freeze only half your rows (e.g., 100 K of 200 K), what kind of refresh time improvement can you expect?
A: Roughly a proportional gain—halving the pulled rows typically cuts variable query time nearly in half; speed-up may be ~40 % overall because fixed overhead (connection setup) remains.





423
Power BI
What pattern lets you reference intermediate calculations by name when building a calculated table?
Use a two-step ADDCOLUMNS approach: first add your intermediate columns, then in a second ADDCOLUMNS call reference those names to compute further results (for example, percentages).





424
Power BI
Q: Why might switching to the Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector improve performance over the SQL connector?
A: The Dataverse connector is designed to leverage server‐side paging and API optimizations, often preserving query folding more reliably and avoiding TDS‐related throttling.





425
Power BI
Q: What is VertiPaq and why is it relevant when appending tables?

427
Power BI
Q: How do incremental refresh policies handle late-arriving data, and what can you do to mitigate missed updates?
    A:

    Incremental refresh typically uses a RangeStart/RangeEnd window; any rows older than RangeStart aren’t re-queried.

    To capture late-arriving updates, include a “stale data window” (e.g., overlapping dates) so you reprocess recent partitions that might receive back‐dated changes, then drop duplicates in Power Query or DAX.





428
Power BI
What is the difference between row context and filter context in DAX?
Row context iterates over rows (as in iterators like SUMX or SUMMARIZE), while filter context filters tables for evaluation (as in measures and visuals). CALCULATE is the primary way to convert row context into filter context and apply or modify filters.





429
Power BI
Why might SUMMARIZECOLUMNS yield better performance than SUMMARIZE?
The Tabular engine has built-in optimizations for SUMMARIZECOLUMNS that reduce temporary table materializations and merge identical aggregations, resulting in faster query plans, especially on large fact tables.





430
Power BI
When would you use GENERATESERIES in DAX?

@contextmanager
def change_dir(destination):
    original_dir = os.getcwd()
    os.chdir(destination)
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        os.chdir(original_dir)

# Usage
with change_dir('/new/path'):
    # Code operates in '/new/path'
    pass
# Returns to original directory





442
Python
Using the list() constructor to turn a generator into a list.

446
Python
Q:
How can you memoize a generator function to cache its results?

A:
By using decorators like functools.lru_cache() on generator functions, although it's generally more suited for regular functions. For generators, you might need to implement custom caching.

Note:
functools.lru_cache() does not work directly with generator functions since they return iterators. Instead, consider converting the generator to a list and then caching.





447
Python
The purpose of the @contextmanager decorator in the contextlib module is to simplify the creation of context managers by allowing you to write a generator function that yields control back to the context.

Example:
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def my_context():
    # Setup code
    yield
    # Teardown code





448
Python
Q:
How can you ensure that all resources are properly released when using multiple context managers?

A:
By using nested with statements or contextlib.ExitStack to manage multiple context managers efficiently.

Example with ExitStack:
from contextlib import ExitStack

with ExitStack() as stack:
    file1 = stack.enter_context(open('file1.txt'))
    file2 = stack.enter_context(open('file2.txt'))
    # Work with files





449
Python
Q:
What is the benefit of using binary mode ('rb' or 'wb') when opening files with pathlib?

Azure Files Documentation
File shares (preview), offered by the Microsoft.FileShares resource provider. File shares are a new top-level resource that simplify the deployment of Azure Files by eliminating the storage account. Unlike classic file shares, which must be deployed into a storage account, file shares are deployed directly into the resource group like storage accounts themselves





521
Azure Files Documentation
Pay-as-you-go storage accounts are distinguished using the StorageV2 storage account kind. 
They allow you to deploy file shares on HDD based hardware. 
They can be used to store classic file shares and other storage resources such as blob containers, queues, or tables.





522
Azure Files Documentation
NFS file shares are accessible from the storage account's public endpoint if and only if the storage account's public endpoint is restricted to specific virtual networks using service endpoints. See public endpoint firewall settings for additional information on service endpoints.





523
Azure Files Documentation
Soft delete is a storage-account level setting that allows you to recover your file share when it's accidentally deleted. When a file share is deleted, it transitions to a soft deleted state instead of being permanently erased. You can configure the amount of time soft deleted shares are recoverable before they're permanently deleted.





524
Azure Files Documentation
Many important settings, such as network and security rules, are applied at the storage account level. You should consider the storage account to be a trust boundary and only place classic file shares in the same storage account if you're ok with them having the same security settings.

OAuth 2.0 RFC6749
OAuth defines four roles:

   resource owner
   resource server

   client
      An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the
      resource owner and with its authorization.  The term "client" does
      not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g.,
      whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other
      devices).

   authorization server





529
OAuth 2.0 RFC6749
For example, an end-user (resource owner) can grant a printing
   service (client) access to her protected photos stored at a photo-
   sharing service (resource server), without sharing her username and
   password with the printing service.  Instead, she authenticates
   directly with a server trusted by the photo-sharing service
   (authorization server), which issues the printing service delegation-
   specific credentials (access token).





530
OAuth 2.0 RFC6749
Access tokens
   are issued to third-party clients by an authorization server with the
   approval of the resource owner.  The client uses the access token to
   access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.

In a data loss prevention policy, you:

    Define the sensitive information you want to monitor for, like financial, health, medical, and privacy data.
    Where to monitor, like Microsoft 365 services or Windows and macOS devices.
    The conditions that must be matched for a policy to be applied to an item, like items containing credit card, driver's license, or social security numbers.
    The actions to take when a match is found, like audit, block the activity, and block the activity with override.

DLP policies are how you monitor the activities that users take on sensitive items at rest, sensitive items in transit, or sensitive items in use and then take protective actions. For example, when a user attempts a prohibited action, like copying a sensitive item to an unapproved location or sharing medical information in an email, DLP can:

show a pop-up policy tip to the user that warns them that they might be trying to share a sensitive item inappropriately

Power BI
Q: How can you verify gateway-related issues are not causing silent failures?
A: Download gateway logs (Admin Portal → Gateways → Diagnostics) and search for timeouts or errors (e.g., QueryTimeoutException). Also check gateway CPU/memory spikes.





691
Power BI
Q: Why is a 200 K-row table (40 MB PBIX) unlikely to be “too large” for Power BI Desktop?
A: Power BI regularly handles multi-million-row tables under 100 MB if well-modeled; a 200 K-row table is small. Performance issues usually stem from query complexity or broken folding, not raw size.





692
Power BI
Q: What are common pitfalls when manually partitioning with two queries?
A: Forgetting to disable History after its catch-up refresh (causes full pull), mismatched schemas between History & Recent, and letting the Historical table outgrow available memory.





693
Power BI
Q: What role does Data Profiling in Power Query play when troubleshooting refresh issues?
A:

    Data Profiling (enable under View → Column quality/Column distribution) lets you see values, error rates, and distinct counts.

    Helps identify unexpected nulls, data type mismatches, or outliers that could increase transformation complexity or break folding.





694
Power BI
Q: What is the effect of data type mismatches on Power Query folding and performance?
    A:

    If you change a column’s data type (e.g., from text to date) before filtering, Power Query may break folding because the source might not support that conversion natively.

    Always apply type conversions at the end, after filters, or ensure the source can natively convert the type in the same query.





695
Power BI
Q: Why might a table visual in Power BI show fewer rows than exist in the dataset even if the data model has all rows?
A: Large table visuals can hit rendering timeouts or be partially truncated. Use Performance Analyzer to see if the DAX query or visual rendering is timing out.





696
Power BI
Q: What are the two main components of query execution time when pulling data via SQL?
A: Fixed costs (connection setup, query plan, authentication, network latency) and variable costs (reading/transmitting each row). Reducing row count cuts the variable portion.





697
Power BI
Q: What are the risks of using a static RangeStart parameter over a long period?
A: If you never update RangeStart, new “late-arriving” or back‐dated changes older than that date won’t be captured. You risk permanently missing updates unless you periodically advance the boundary.





698
Power BI
Q: What is “query folding” and why does it matter for refresh timeouts?
A: Query folding means pushing filtering/sorting logic down to the data source. If a step breaks folding, Power Query pulls all rows client-side, increasing data volume and risking timeouts.





699
Power BI
Q: Why might “Rows Loaded” in Refresh History show fewer rows than expected even when the status is “Succeeded”?
A: A query may have partially timed out or a partition returned 0 rows (e.g., due to filter/timeout). “Succeeded” can hide warnings about QueryTimeout or skipped partitions.





700
Power BI
Q: Name one alternative to the SQL connector when connecting to Dataverse that can improve folding and avoid timeouts.
A: Use the built-in Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector via Get Data → Dataverse. It often auto-folds better into Dataverse’s paging model than the SQL (TDS) endpoint.

pbar.close()





707
Python
Q:
What is the difference between itertools.accumulate() and itertools.reduce()?

A:
itertools.accumulate() returns an iterator that yields accumulated sums (or results of a specified function), while functools.reduce() applies a function cumulatively to the items of a sequence, reducing it to a single value.





708
Python
Q:
How can you profile a generator to identify performance bottlenecks?

A:
By using profiling tools like cProfile to analyze the generator’s execution and identify slow parts.

print(result.returncode)





713
Python
Q:
How can generators be used to implement a producer-consumer pattern?

A:
Generators can act as producers by yielding data, which consumers can iterate over, allowing for efficient and decoupled data processing.

Example:
def producer():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i

def consumer(gen):
    for item in gen:
        print(f"Consumed: {item}")

gen = producer()
consumer(gen)

        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            attempts = 0
            while attempts < max_retries:
                try:
                    return func(*args, **kwargs)
                except Exception as e:
                    attempts += 1
                    print(f"Attempt {attempts} failed: {e}")
            raise Exception("Maximum retries exceeded")
        return wrapper
    return decorator

pfSense
Bogon networks are those which should never be seen on the Internet, including reserved and unassigned IP address space.

If any interfaces are configured to Block Bogon Networks, then shortly after initial installation and once per month after that, pfSense software will contact Netgate servers to obtain an updated list of Bogon Networks.





739
pfSense
The name of a FreeBSD interface starts with the name of its network driver. It is then followed by a number starting at 0 that increases incrementally by one for each additional interface sharing that driver. For example, a common driver used by Intel gigabit network interface cards is igb. The first such card in a firewall will be igb0, the second is igb1, and so on.





740
pfSense
For several essential and optional services, such as checking for updates, installing updates and packages, and the Auto Config Backup service, pfSense® software makes outgoing connections to servers owned and operated by Netgate.





741
pfSense
pfSense software also transmits a unique and random “device key” to privately identify which backups belong to a given installation.

This device key must be unique to each firewall backing up its configuration. To do this the key is automatically generated by taking the SHA256 hash of the SSH service keys on the installation. This allows ACB to reliably and properly identify ownership of each backup in an anonymous way.

Declares that `token_dict` is a global variable so it can be modified inside the `do_GET` method. This is where the access token and other OAuth metadata are stored after the token exchange.





748
Python + Oauth2.0
handler.wfile.write()

Writes raw bytes to the response body. In your code, it sends a message like “You may close this window” back to the browser after the authorization code is received.
handler is an instance of OAuthHandler, which inherits from http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler





749
Python + Oauth2.0
handler.end_headers()

Finalizes the HTTP response headers. It must be called after `handler.send_response()` and before writing any content to the response body.

750
Python + Oauth2.0
socketserver.TCPServer

A Python class that creates a simple TCP server. In this script, it listens on `localhost:8080` and uses `OAuthHandler` to handle incoming requests. The server runs inside a context manager to ensure it shuts down cleanly after handling one request.





751
Python + Oauth2.0
handle_request()

A method of `TCPServer` that waits for a single incoming request and then processes it using the specified handler class. It’s used here to catch the OAuth redirect containing the authorization code.





752
Python + Oauth2.0
handler.send_response()

Sends an HTTP status code back to the client (browser). For example, `handler.send_response(200)` indicates success, while `handler.send_response(400)` signals a bad request.

Disabling GenerateMeta in CCH Axcess export options prevents exporting metadata that may reveal unnecessary internal field labels or system details.





756
CCH Tax Forms Project
Namespaces in XML appear as long URIs in tags (e.g., {http://…}Identifier), and in ElementTree you can split on } to isolate the local tag name.





757
CCH Tax Forms Project
xml.etree.ElementTree.iterparse() is a Python standard library parser that reads XML incrementally, making it memory-efficient for large documents.
In ElementTree, listening for "end" events ensures you process each XML element only after it has been fully parsed.

Active Directory and Azure Files
SIDHistory
An attribute that holds old SIDs when accounts are migrated. Ensures access continuity. Relevant if you ever migrate domains and still want Azure Files ACLs to work.





762
Active Directory and Azure Files
Token Groups
When a user logs in, AD builds a token containing all their SIDs (user SID + group SIDs). This token is compared against ACLs.





763
Active Directory and Azure Files
Forest Functional Level (FFL) / Domain Functional Level (DFL)
Settings that define which AD features are available, based on the OS version of your DCs. Can matter when integrating newer features like Azure AD Connect.





764
Active Directory and Azure Files
Ticket Granting Service (TGS)
The Kerberos service on the DC that issues service tickets (based on your TGT).





765
Active Directory and Azure Files
User Account
An AD object representing a person or service. Not recommended for Azure Files because passwords usually expire.





766
Active Directory and Azure Files
DNS in AD
AD-integrated DNS zones store the records that let clients locate DCs (_kerberos._tcp, _ldap._tcp). Without this, Kerberos won’t work.





767
Active Directory and Azure Files
Time Skew
Kerberos is sensitive to clock drift. If a client and DC differ by more than ~5 minutes, tickets are rejected. Important when mixing on-prem and cloud.





768
Active Directory and Azure Files
Private Endpoint DNS Resolution
Clients mounting Azure Files over Kerberos must resolve the file endpoint (<storageaccount>.file.core.windows.net) to the private endpoint’s IP.





769
Active Directory and Azure Files
Azure Entra ID Kerberos (AAD Kerberos)
A newer model where Entra ID itself issues Kerberos tickets. Removes dependency on on-prem AD DS but behaves slightly differently.





770
Active Directory and Azure Files
Kerberos Key (Storage Account key)
A secret (kerb1 or kerb2) generated on the storage account. Written to the computer account’s password so Kerberos tickets can be validated.





771
Active Directory and Azure Files
Domain
A logical security boundary and namespace (e.g., corp.contoso.com) that contains users, computers, and policies.





772
Active Directory and Azure Files
Domain SID
The SID of the domain itself. Passed into Azure Files configuration so it can translate user/group SIDs correctly for access checks.

Azure Files Documentation
You can enable identity-based authentication over SMB using one of three identity sources: On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Microsoft Entra Domain Services, or Microsoft Entra Kerberos (hybrid identities only). You can only use one identity source for file access authentication per storage account.





777
Azure Files Documentation
Enabling AD DS authentication for your Azure file shares allows you to authenticate to your Azure file shares with your on-premises AD DS credentials. Further, it allows you to better manage your permissions to allow granular access control.





778
Azure Files Documentation
To assign share-level RBAC permissions to specific users or groups, on-premises AD DS identities must be synced to Microsoft Entra ID using Entra Connect Sync. If identities aren't synced, you must use a default share-level permission, which applies to all authenticated users

Azure Files Documentation
The Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) is integrated with other Windows Server security services that run on the domain controller. The KDC uses the domain's Active Directory Domain Services database as its security account database. Active Directory Domain Services is required for default Kerberos implementations within the domain or forest.





787
Azure Files Documentation
You can back up your Azure file share via share snapshots, which are read-only, point-in-time copies of your share. Snapshots are incremental, meaning they only contain as much data as has changed since the previous snapshot. You can have up to 200 snapshots per file share and retain them for up to 10 years.





788
Azure Files Documentation
Beginning with Windows Server 2025, Kerberos no longer honors the legacy registry key REG_DWORD SupportedEncryptionTypes found in the path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Parameters. Microsoft recommends using group policy instead.





789
Azure Files Documentation
Azure Backup for Azure file shares handles the scheduling and retention of snapshots. Its grandfather-father-son (GFS) capabilities mean that you can take daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly snapshots, each with their own distinct retention period.





790
Azure Files Documentation
You can access your Azure file shares over the public internet accessible endpoint, over one or more private endpoints on your network(s), or by caching your Azure file share on-premises with Azure File Sync (SMB file shares only).

Azure Files Documentation
SMB file shares communicate over port 445, which many organizations and internet service providers (ISPs) block for outbound (internet) traffic. This practice originates from legacy security guidance about deprecated and non-internet safe versions of the SMB protocol. SMB 3.x does not share these vulnerabilities.

OAuth 2.0 RFC6749
The OAuth 1.0 protocol ([RFC5849]), published as an informational
   document, was the result of a small ad hoc community effort.  This
   Standards Track specification builds on the OAuth 1.0 deployment
   experience, as well as additional use cases and extensibility
   requirements gathered from the wider IETF community.  The OAuth 2.0
   protocol is not backward compatible with OAuth 1.0.





794
OAuth 2.0 RFC6749
In OAuth, the client requests access to resources controlled
   by the resource owner and hosted by the resource server, and is
   issued a different set of credentials than those of the resource
   owner.
