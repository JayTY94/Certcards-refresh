When writing a DAX formula that uses operators to combine different data types, you don't need to explicitly convert types. Usually, DAX automatically identifies the data types of referenced model objects and performs implicit conversions where necessary to complete the specified operation.

Model data types aren't the same as DAX data types, though a direct relationship exists between them. 

Model data type         DAX data type
Whole number            64-bit integer
Decimal Number          64-bit real
Boolean                 Boolean
Text                    String

Power BI Desktop supports a feature called What-if parameters. When you create a what-if parameter, a calculated table is automatically added to your model.

What-if parameters allow report users to select or filter by values that are stored in the calculated table. Measure formulas can use selected value(s) in a meaningful way.

All Azure subscriptions have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. Subscriptions rely on this tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. When a subscription expires, the trusted instance remains, but the security principals lose access to Azure resources.

The areas where calculated columns and measures differ include:
Visual use - Calculated columns (like any column) can be used to filter, group, or summarize (as an implicit measure), whereas measures are designed to summarize.

BLANK is handled differently, depending on the operator that is used. It's handled similar to how Excel treats BLANK, but differently to how databases (SQL) treat NULL. BLANK is treated as zero when acted on by arithmetic operators and as an empty string when concatenated to a string.

If your formula needs to reference columns in other tables, and if the tables are related, directly or indirectly, you can use the RELATED or RELATEDTABLE DAX function. The RELATED function retrieves the value at the one-side of the relationship, while the RELATEDTABLE retrieves values on the many-side. The RELATEDTABLE function returns a table object.

MS Data Analyst
If your formula needs to reference columns in other tbales and the tables aren't related, you can use the LOOKUPVALUE DAX function. Generally, try to use the RELATED function whenever possible. It will usually perform better than the LOOKUPVALUE function due to the ways that relationship and column data is stored and indexed.

I got access to the PracticePro 365 database using the following steps:
  Go to the dataset in the web app
  downloaded the dataset as a .pbix
  That dataset had all of the tables created as import objects
  That means that I had the queries that created them.
  I still don't have access to all of the tables, but it might be enough.

3. You're developing a Power BI desktop model that sources data from an Excel workbook. The workbook has an employee table that stores one row for each employee. Each row has a reference to the employee's manager, which is also a row in the employee table. You need to add several columns to the Employee table in your model to analyze payroll data within the organization hierarchy (like, executive level, manager level, and so on). Which technique will you use to add the columns? 

You can use the DAX parent-child functions to naturalize the recursive (employee-manager) relationship into columns.

Time intelligence calculations modify date filter contexts. They can help you answer these time-related questions:

• What's the accumulation of revenue for the year, quarter, or month?
• What revenue was produced for the same period last year?
What growth in revenue has been achieved over the same period last year?

Many DAX time intelligence functions are concerned with standard date periods, specifically years, quarters, and months. If you have irregular time periods (for example, financial months that begin mid-way through the calendar month), or you need to work with weeks or time periods (hours, minutes, and so on), the DAX time intelligence functions won't be helpful. Instead, you'll need to use the CALCULATE function and pass in hand-crafted date or time filters.

Requirements for a date table
  It must have a column of data type Date (or date/time), known as the date column.
  The date column must contain unique values.
  The date column must not contain BLANKs.
  The date column must not have any missing dates.
  The date column must span full years. A year isn't necessarily a calendar year (January-December).
  The date table must be indicated as a date table.

2. You're developing a semantic model in Power BI Desktop. You've just added a date table by using the CALENDARAUTO function. You've extended it with calculated columns, and you've related it to other model tables. What else should you do to ensure that DAX time intelligence calculations work correctly? 

You must mark the date table so that Power BI can correctly filter its dates.

3. You have a table that stores account balance snapshots for each date, excluding weekends. You need to ensure that your measure formula only filters by a single date. Also, if no record is on the last date of a time period, it should use the latest account balance. Which DAX time intelligence function should you use? 

The LASTNONBLANK function will return the last date in the filter context where a snapshot record exists. This option will help you achieve the objective.

Visual cache - When you load a visual, you can't clear this visual cache without closing Power BI Desktop and opening it again. To avoid any caching in play, you need to start your analysis with a clean visual cache.

To ensure that you have a clear visual cache, add a blank page to your Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file and then, with that page selected, save and close the file. Reopen the Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file that you want to analyze. It will open on the blank page.

Data engine cache - When a query is run, the results are cached, so the results of your analysis will be misleading. You need to clear the data cache before rerunning the visual.

To clear the data cache, you can either restart Power BI Desktop or connect DAX Studio to the semantic model and then call Clear Cache.

Type of Performance Analyzer task:
Other - The time it took the visual to prepare queries, wait for other visuals to complete, or perform other background processing tasks. If this category displays a long duration, the only real way to reduce this duration is to optimize DAX queries for other visuals, or reduce the number of visuals in the report.

The more visuals you have on the report, the higher chance for performance issues. In addition, the more visuals, the more the report can appear crowded and lose clarity. The upper limit for visuals is 100 fields (measures or columns), so a visual with more than 100 fields will be slow to load.

Suppose that you have an ID column with thousands of unique rows. You know that you won't use this particular column in a relationship, so it will not be used in a report. Therefore, you should consider this column as unnecessary and admit that it is wasting space in your semantic model.






13
MS Data Analyst
Other metadata that you should consider is the information about the semantic model as a whole, such as the file size and data refresh rates. You can find this metadata in the associated Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file. The data that you load into Power BI Desktop is compressed and stored to the disk by the VertiPaq storage engine.




14

Another item to consider when optimizing performance is the Auto date/time option in Power BI Desktop. By default, this feature is enabled globally, which means that Power BI Desktop automatically creates a hidden calculated table for each date column, provided that certain conditions are met.

Variables do not require the use of EARLIER or EARLIEST DAX functions, which are difficult to understand. These functions were required before variables were introduced, and were written in complex expressions that introduced new filter contexts. Now that you can use variables instead of those functions, you can write fewer complex formulas.
