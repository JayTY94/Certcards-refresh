when you create a VM the operating system data is updated with several items, including:

The host name of your VM.
The administrator username and credentials.
Log files.
Security identifiers for various operating system services.

These items must be reset to their default settings before you capture an image. When you reset these items in a VM, you generalize the VM.

A warning with query diagnostics, as mentioned elsewhere, is that you'll see drastically different capabilities depending on the connector. For example, many ODBC based connectors won't have an accurate recording of what query is send to the actual backend system, as Power Query only sees what it sends to the ODBC driver.






197
Power BI
One of the most common reasons to use Query Diagnostics is to have a better understanding of what operations were 'pushed down' by Power Query to be performed by the back-end data source, which is also known as 'folding'. If we want to see what folded, we can look at what is the 'most specific' query, or queries, that get sent to the back-end data source.

Multiple requests to the same data source can occur if multiple queries pull from that data source. These requests can happen even in a case where only one query references the data source.

As an alternative approach, you can also enter the formula try [Standard Rate] catch ()=> [Special Rate], which is equivalent to the previous formula, but using the catch keyword with a function that requires no parameters.

If errors are found in the Standard Rate column, then the output will be the value defined after the otherwise statement, which in this case is the special rate.

When trying to diagnose #REF errors in a Power Query column, consider adding a new custom column with the formula

Power Apps
As a minimum, a model-driven app requires a single table, a site map, plus the app itself. However, model-driven apps generally include a considerable amount more, and this includes canvas apps, security roles, environment variables, and much more.

For some reason, when I was trying to update C&Y's Billing Managers and Project Managers, I was getting a partial failure when trying to use the Import feature from the Power Apps table. I ended up having to write a Power Automate script to edit the records.

A web front-end cluster consists of an ASP.NET website that runs in the Azure App Service Environment. When a user visits a Power Platform service or application, the client's DNS service may get the most appropriate (usually nearest) datacenter from the Azure Traffic Manager. For more information, see Performance traffic-routing method for Azure Traffic Manager.

Back-end clusters are stateful. A back-end cluster hosts all the data of all the tenants assigned to it. The cluster that contains the data of a specific tenant is referred to as the tenant’s home cluster. Information about an authenticated user's home cluster is provided by the Power Platform global back-end service to the web front-end cluster.

Power BI
When you display the usage metrics report, Power BI generates a pre-built report. It contains usage metrics for that content for the last 30 days. The report looks similar to the Power BI reports you're already familiar with. You can slice based on how your end users received access, whether they accessed via the web or mobile app, and so on.

Usage metrics reports don't show up in Recent, Workspaces, Favorites, or other content lists. They can't be added to an app. If you pin a tile from a usage metrics report to a dashboard, you can't add that dashboard to an app.

The Usage Metrics Report semantic model contains usage data for the last 30 days. It can take up to 24 hours for new usage data to be imported. You can't trigger a manual refresh by using the Power BI user interface.

Usage metrics reports are a feature that the Power BI or global administrator can turn on or off. Administrators have granular control over which users have access to usage metrics; they're On by default for all users in the organization. See Audit and usage metrics in the Admin portal article for details on these settings.
