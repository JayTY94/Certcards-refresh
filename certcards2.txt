Accounting
Under the accrual method, revenue is accounted for when it is earned. Unlike the cash method, the accrual method records revenue when a product or service is delivered to a customer with the expectation that money will be paid in the future. In other words, money is accounted for before it’s received. Likewise, expenses for goods and services are recorded before any cash is paid out for them2

Microsoft Data Analyst
Data scientists perform advanced analytics to extract value from data. Their work can vary from descriptive analytics to predictive analytics. Descriptive analytics evaluate data through a process known as exploratory data analysis (EDA). Predictive analytics are used in machine learning to apply modeling techniques that can detect anomalies or patterns.

Data modeling is the process of determining how your tables are related to each other. This process is done by defining and creating relationships between the tables. From that point, you can enhance the model by defining metrics and adding custom calculations to enrich your data.

shutil.move() is a function in the Python module shutil, which allows the user to perform advanced operations on system files and a collection of files. It moves a file or directory (source) to another location (destination) and returns the destination. It works by creating a copy of the source in the destination and deleting the original source, unless it is protected.

Data preparation is the process of taking raw data and turning it into information that is trusted and understandable. It involves, among other things, ensuring the integrity of the data, correcting wrong or inaccurate data, identifying missing data, converting data from one structure to another or from one type to another, or even a task as simple as making data more readable.

MS Teams
When you invite a guest to Teams, a guest account is created for them in Azure Active Directory and they are covered by the same compliance and auditing protection as other Microsoft 365 users. Guest access is subject to Azure AD and Microsoft 365 service limits.

Data pipelines are used to orchestrate activities that transfer and transform data. Pipelines are the primary way in which data engineers implement repeatable extract, transform, and load (ETL) solutions that can be triggered based on a schedule or in response to events.

The reports that are created during the visualization task help businesses and decision makers understand what that data means so that accurate and vital decisions can be made. Reports drive the overall actions, decisions, and behaviors of an organization that is trusting and relying on the information that is discovered in the data.

Cognitive analytics attempt to draw inferences from existing data and patterns, derive conclusions based on existing knowledge bases, and then add these findings back into the knowledge base for future inferences, a self-learning feedback loop.

Power BI consists of a Microsoft Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop, an online SaaS (Software as a Service) service called the Power BI service, and mobile Power BI apps that are available on any device, with native mobile BI apps for Windows, iOS, and Android.

Descriptive analytics help answer questions about what has happened based on historical data. Descriptive analytics techniques summarize large datasets to describe outcomes to stakeholders.

By developing key performance indicators (KPIs), these strategies can help track the success or failure of key objectives.

A data warehouse is a centralized repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. Data warehouses store current and historical data in relational tables that are organized into a schema that optimizes performance for analytical queries.

Data Transformation: Operational data usually needs to be transformed into suitable structure and format for analysis, often as part of an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process; though increasingly a variation in which you extract, load, and transform (ELT) the data is used to quickly ingest the data into a data lake and then apply "big data" processing techniques to transform it

Eidetic memory, also known as photographic memory and total recall, is the ability to recall an image from memory with high precision—at least for a brief period of time—after seeing it only once and without using a mnemonic device1. The term eidetic comes from the Greek word εἶδος (eidos) meaning "visible form"1.

Generally, diagnostic analytics occurs in three steps:

	Identify anomalies in the data. These anomalies might be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.

	Collect data that's related to these anomalies.

	Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.

Proper management can also help reduce data silos within your organization. Data duplication can make managing and introducing data latency difficult when resources are overused. Power BI helps reduce data silos with the use of shared datasets, and it allows you to reuse data that you have prepared and modeled

The idea with a data lake is to store everything in its original, untransformed state. This approach differs from a traditional data warehouse, which transforms and processes the data at the time of ingestion.





35
Microsoft Data Analyst
Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened. Diagnostic analytics techniques supplement basic descriptive analytics, and they use the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of these events. Then, performance indicators are further investigated to discover why these events improved or became worse.
