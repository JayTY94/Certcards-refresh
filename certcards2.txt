The Jaccard similarity algorithm is a measure used to compare the similarity of two sets. It is defined as the size of the intersection of two sets divided by the size of the union of the two sets. In other words, it measures how many elements are common to both sets out of the total number of distinct elements in both sets. The Jaccard similarity coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 meaning the sets are completely different and 1 meaning the sets are identical.
