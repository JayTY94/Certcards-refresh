Perhaps the most effective technique to reduce a model size is to use a summary table from the data source. Where a detail table might contain every transaction, a summary table would contain one record per day, per week, or per month. It might be an average of all of the transactions per day, for instance.

Other metadata that you should consider is the information about the semantic model as a whole, such as the file size and data refresh rates. You can find this metadata in the associated Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file. The data that you load into Power BI Desktop is compressed and stored to the disk by the VertiPaq storage engine.

2. You're developing a semantic model in Power BI Desktop. You've just added a date table by using the CALENDARAUTO function. You've extended it with calculated columns, and you've related it to other model tables. What else should you do to ensure that DAX time intelligence calculations work correctly? 

You must mark the date table so that Power BI can correctly filter its dates.





20
MS Data Analyst
If your formula needs to reference columns in other tbales and the tables aren't related, you can use the LOOKUPVALUE DAX function. Generally, try to use the RELATED function whenever possible. It will usually perform better than the LOOKUPVALUE function due to the ways that relationship and column data is stored and indexed.





21

To aggregate data to decrease the size of a semantic model for a particuarly large table in Power Query, use Choose Columns on the Home tab to limit the number of columns imported and then choose Group by in the Home tab. Then choose Adavnced and select Add Aggregation





27
MS Data Analyst
Another item to consider when optimizing performance is the Auto date/time option in Power BI Desktop. By default, this feature is enabled globally, which means that Power BI Desktop automatically creates a hidden calculated table for each date column, provided that certain conditions are met.

MS Data Analyst
Variables do not require the use of EARLIER or EARLIEST DAX functions, which are difficult to understand. These functions were required before variables were introduced, and were written in complex expressions that introduced new filter contexts. Now that you can use variables instead of those functions, you can write fewer complex formulas.

Time intelligence calculations modify date filter contexts. They can help you answer these time-related questions:

• What's the accumulation of revenue for the year, quarter, or month?
• What revenue was produced for the same period last year?
What growth in revenue has been achieved over the same period last year?

Visual cache - When you load a visual, you can't clear this visual cache without closing Power BI Desktop and opening it again. To avoid any caching in play, you need to start your analysis with a clean visual cache.

To ensure that you have a clear visual cache, add a blank page to your Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file and then, with that page selected, save and close the file. Reopen the Power BI Desktop (.pbix) file that you want to analyze. It will open on the blank page.

MS Data Analyst
Many DAX time intelligence functions are concerned with standard date periods, specifically years, quarters, and months. If you have irregular time periods (for example, financial months that begin mid-way through the calendar month), or you need to work with weeks or time periods (hours, minutes, and so on), the DAX time intelligence functions won't be helpful. Instead, you'll need to use the CALCULATE function and pass in hand-crafted date or time filters.

Type of Performance Analyzer task:
Other - The time it took the visual to prepare queries, wait for other visuals to complete, or perform other background processing tasks. If this category displays a long duration, the only real way to reduce this duration is to optimize DAX queries for other visuals, or reduce the number of visuals in the report.





43
MS Data Analyst
Data engine cache - When a query is run, the results are cached, so the results of your analysis will be misleading. You need to clear the data cache before rerunning the visual.

To clear the data cache, you can either restart Power BI Desktop or connect DAX Studio to the semantic model and then call Clear Cache.

I got access to the PracticePro 365 database using the following steps:
  Go to the dataset in the web app
  downloaded the dataset as a .pbix
  That dataset had all of the tables created as import objects
  That means that I had the queries that created them.
  I still don't have access to all of the tables, but it might be enough.

DAX Studio
To convert numbers or measures into a table, you need to place it between curly brackets { }. To create a table with two columns, use parenthesis ( ) and write another value separated by a comma. To add another row, you need to place another expression within a parenthesis inside the curly bracket.

3. You have a table that stores account balance snapshots for each date, excluding weekends. You need to ensure that your measure formula only filters by a single date. Also, if no record is on the last date of a time period, it should use the latest account balance. Which DAX time intelligence function should you use? 

The LASTNONBLANK function will return the last date in the filter context where a snapshot record exists. This option will help you achieve the objective.

3. You're developing a Power BI desktop model that sources data from an Excel workbook. The workbook has an employee table that stores one row for each employee. Each row has a reference to the employee's manager, which is also a row in the employee table. You need to add several columns to the Employee table in your model to analyze payroll data within the organization hierarchy (like, executive level, manager level, and so on). Which technique will you use to add the columns? 

You can use the DAX parent-child functions to naturalize the recursive (employee-manager) relationship into columns.





60
MS Data Analyst
If your formula needs to reference columns in other tables, and if the tables are related, directly or indirectly, you can use the RELATED or RELATEDTABLE DAX function. The RELATED function retrieves the value at the one-side of the relationship, while the RELATEDTABLE retrieves values on the many-side. The RELATEDTABLE function returns a table object.





61
MS Data Analyst
LASTNONBLANK(<column>, <expression>)

<column>: A column expression.
<expression>: An expression evaluated for blanks for each value of column2.
The function returns a table containing a single column and single row with the computed last value123. This function is particularly useful when you need to analyze and present data where the last non-blank value holds significant importance, such as tracking the latest sales figures or monitoring inventory levels5.





62
MS Data Analyst
3. Which of the following statements about relationships in Power BI Desktop is true? 
Relationships can be created between tables that contain different types of data.
A working relationship can be created as long as there is at least one common column between them.





63
MS Data Analyst
2. What can be achieved by removing unnecessary rows and columns? 
Deleting unnecessary rows and columns will reduce a semantic model size and it's good practice to load only necessary data into your semantic model.





64
MS Data Analyst
Before you run Performance analyzer, to ensure you get the most accurate results in your analysis (test), make sure that you start with a clear visual cache and a clear data engine cache.

Dynamic rules use specific DAX functions that return environmental values (as opposed to constants). Environmental values are returned from three specific DAX functions:

USERNAME or USERPRINCIPALNAME – Returns the Power BI authenticated user as a text value.

CUSTOMDATA - Returns the CustomData property passed in the connection string. Non-Power BI reporting tools that connect to the dataset by using a connection string can set this property, like Microsoft Excel.

MS Data Analyst
Role mappings must be set up in advance of users accessing Power BI content. Role mapping involves assigning Microsoft Entra security objects to roles. Security objects can be user accounts or security groups.






4
MS Data Analyst
When possible, it’s a good practice to map roles to security groups. That way, there will be fewer mappings, and you can delegate the group membership management to the network administrators.






5
MS Data Analyst
you can consider restricting user access to Power BI model objects. Object-level security (OLS) can restrict access to specific tables and columns, and their metadata. Typically, you apply OLS to secure objects that store sensitive data, like employee personal data.






6
MS Data Analyst
When Power BI enforces OLS, not only does it restrict access to tables and columns, but it can also secure metadata. When you secure metadata, it’s not possible to retrieve information about secured tables and columns by using Dynamic Management Views (DMVs).






7
MS Data Analyst
OLS is a feature inherited from Azure Analysis Services (AAS) and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). The feature is available in Power BI Premium to provide backward compatibility for models migrated to Power BI. For this reason, it’s not possible to completely set up OLS in Power BI Desktop.






8
MS Data Analyst
You can’t mix RLS and OLS in the same role. If you need to apply RLS and OLS in the same model, create separate roles dedicated to each type. Also, you can’t set table-level security if it breaks a relationship chain. For example, if there are relationships between tables A and B, and B and C, you can't secure table B.




9
MS Data Analyst
Use the USERPRINCIPALNAME function instead of USERNAME function. It provides consistency when validating the roles in Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service.




10
MS Data Analyst
It’s efficient to apply rules to dimension tables. Power BI filters the dimension tables (that usually have a small number of rows) and uses model relationships to propagate those filters to fact tables (that contain millions of rows).

Rupali is a data modeler at Adventure Works who is developing an import model to analyze employee timesheet data. The employee table stores the employee social security number (SSN) in a column. While the model will be available for all company managers, it will also be available to employees in the Payroll department. However, reports must only reveal employee SSNs to payroll employees. What feature should Rupali use to restrict access to the SSN column? 

You can use OLS (object-level security) to secure the SSN column in the employee table.

MS Data Analyst
An analyst is a person who provides guidance to the organization. Analysts can be responsible for a range of tasks, often with goals of determining the effectiveness of business strategies, developing or improving processes, or implementing change. A business analyst (or data analyst) in the sales division of the Contoso Skateboard Store is an example of an analyst audience.






17
MS Data Analyst
An information worker is someone who uses data to help make decisions or take actions. Often, these decisions and actions are operational in that they are done on a daily basis. The inventory manager at the Contoso Skateboard Store, who needs up-to-date information about stock levels, is an example of an information worker audience.
