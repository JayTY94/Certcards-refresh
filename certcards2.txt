Name this new column Final Rate. The formula above will try to evaluate the Standard Rate column and will output its value if no errors are found. If errors are found in the Standard Rate column, then the output will be the value defined after the otherwise statement, which in this case is the special rate.

Python sequences have three common characteristics:

  They are iterable, which means you can iterate through them.
  They have a length, which means you can pass them to len() to get the number of elements it contains.
  An element of a sequence can be accessed based on its position in the sequence using an integer index.

When you pass a list of columns to the values parameter in a pandas pivot table, the columns are displayed alphabetically in the output. That’s regardless of the order they were passed in.






2222
Python
When you need to apply multiple aggregation functions to the same data in a pivot table, you pass them in a list to the 
aggfunc
 parameter.




2222
Python
In pandas, you have several methods at your disposal for data aggregation:

.pivot_table() is great for creating pivot tables that summarize data.
.groupby() is used to group data according to the values in one or more columns.
crosstab() is used to compute a cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors.




2222
Python
With .pivot(), you can only reshape data rows and columns. You can’t use it to aggregate data.

Both methods are still available and do different things.

The .pivot() method doesn’t support multi-level indexes, whereas .pivot_table() does.

Because of its data aggregation abilities, .pivot_table() is more powerful.

According to the Python documentation, which format presentation type will display a fixed amount of decimal places—NAN for missing data and INF for infinite data?

F




2222
Python
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so replacing the "var" function with "std" is the best approach.

You could calculate the square roots of the existing pivot table data, but this complicates the code.

Power BI
The SUMMARIZE function in DAX is a powerful function used to create summary tables or groupings of data based on specified columns and expressions. It essentially performs a GROUP BY operation similar to SQL.






2210
Power BI
SUMMARIZE ( <table>, <group_by_column1>, ..., <group_by_columnN>, <expression1>, ..., <expressionN> )
Arguments:
<table>: The table or table expression from which to retrieve data.
<group_by_column1>, ..., <group_by_columnN>: Columns to group the data by. Each unique combination of values in these columns defines a group.
<expression1>, ..., <expressionN>: Optional expressions to compute values for each group. These expressions could be aggregations, calculations, or any other DAX expressions.






2210
Power BI
SUMMARIZE generates a summary table that includes unique combinations of values from the specified group by columns.
For each group, it computes the values specified in the expressions. If no expressions are provided, SUMMARIZE simply returns the distinct combinations of group by columns.
It returns a table with columns specified in both group by columns and expressions.

Python
String interpolation in Python involves inserting objects into a string. The primary tools for this are:

f-strings: Provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals using curly braces {}.

str.format() method: Allows for complex variable substitutions and value formatting.

modulo operator (%): An older method for string formatting using format specifiers like %s and %d.






2241
Python
F-strings are evaluated at runtime, meaning that the expressions inside the curly braces are inserted when the code that defines the string runs.





2241
Python
Adding an equal sign after a variable or expression in an f-string creates a self-documenting expression. This feature is particularly useful for debugging because it not only shows the result of the expression but also the expression itself, making what is being evaluated clear. For example, print(f"{value = }") would output value = Suspicious value, showing both the variable name and its value.







2241
Python
In Python f-strings, the flags !s and !r allow you to control how objects are converted into strings. The !s flag uses the object’s .__str__() method, which is intended to return a user-friendly string representation. The !r flag uses the object’s .__repr__() method, which should return a developer-friendly string representation that could be used to re-create the object.







2241
Python
The .format() method in Python supports different configurations for string interpolation:

Empty replacement fields use the default order of arguments.
Zero-based indices allow you to specify the order of arguments.
Named replacement fields improve readability by matching the arguments’ names in the method call.





2241
Python
The !r flag in Python’s .format() method uses the repr() function to provide a developer-friendly string representation of an object.

Conversely, the !s flag uses the str() function to produce a user-friendly string representation, which is generally more readable and concise.





2241
Python
Named replacement fields allow you to insert values from a dictionary into a string by using keys. This method is more readable and intuitive than using positional arguments with tuples.







2241
Python
The .format() method is recommended for lazy string interpolation, where you need to create a reusable string template that can be interpolated later. This is useful when you don’t have all the data available when creating the string, or when the same format is used multiple times with different data.







2241
Python
In contrast, f-strings perform eager interpolation and are not suitable for these scenarios. You can learn more about the differences and use cases for these methods in the Using F-strings vs .format() vs % section in the tutorial.







2241
Python
In a Python Template string, placeholders consist of two parts: a dollar sign ($) followed by a valid Python identifier. This is different from other string interpolation methods that might use curly braces or percentage symbols. Valid identifiers are those that can be used as variable names in Python, which include letters, underscores, and digits but can’t start with a digit or be a Python keyword.






2241
Python
The correct syntax for unpacking a dictionary into keyword arguments in Python is the ** operator. This operator unpacks the key-value pairs from the dictionary, allowing them to be used as keyword arguments in functions or methods.






2241
Python
When you use the .safe_substitute() method from the Template class with a dictionary that doesn’t match all placeholders, it returns the string with the missing placeholders shown as is. This method doesn’t raise a KeyError like the .format() method does when faced with missing keys.

In DAX, when you use SUMX or similar functions that iterate over a table, the context within which the function operates changes to the row context of that table. This means each row of the table becomes the current context for the calculation during each iteration of the function. Because of this row context, you don’t need to explicitly reference the table name when accessing its columns within the function.
