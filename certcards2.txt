The Jaccard similarity algorithm is a measure used to compare the similarity of two sets. It is defined as the size of the intersection of two sets divided by the size of the union of the two sets. In other words, it measures how many elements are common to both sets out of the total number of distinct elements in both sets. The Jaccard similarity coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 meaning the sets are completely different and 1 meaning the sets are identical.

The visualizations on a Power Bi Dashboard are called tiles and are pined to the dashboard by report designers. In most cases, selecting a tile takes you to the report page where the visualization was created.

Power BI
The visualizations on a dashboard come from reports, and each report is based on one dataset. You can think of a dashboard as an entryway into the underlying reports and datasets. Select a visualization to take you to the report that was used to create it.

Think of data culture as what you do, not what you say. Your data culture is not a set of rules (that's governance). So, data culture is a somewhat abstract concept. It's the behaviors and norms that are allowed, rewarded, and encouraged—or those that are disallowed and discouraged.

The vision of a healthy data culture should

	• Originate from the executive level
	• Align with organizational objectives
	• Directly influence your adoption strategy.
    • Serve as the high-level guiding principles for enacting governance policies and guidelines.
