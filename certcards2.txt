Microsoft Purview
You can configure your policies so that, when a DLP policy is triggered, email notifications are sent automatically, and policy tips are shown to admins and end users. Policy tips are useful ways to raise awareness of risky behaviors on sensitive items and train users to avoid those behaviors in the future.





23
Microsoft Purview
When you create your DLP policies, you should consider rolling them out gradually, so you can assess their impact and test their effectiveness before fully enforcing them. For example, you don't want a new DLP policy to unintentionally block access to thousands of documents or to break an existing business process.





24
Microsoft Purview
To get started quickly, you might pick the preconfigured U.K. Financial Data policy template, which includes the Credit Card Number, EU Debit Card Number, and SWIFT Code sensitive information types.





25
Microsoft Purview
When you create your sensitivity labels in the Microsoft Purview portal, they appear in a list on the Labels page from Information Protection. In this list, the order of the labels is important because it sets their priority. You want your most restrictive sensitivity label, such as Highly Confidential to appear at the bottom of the list and your least restrictive sensitivity label, such as Personal or Public, to appear at the top.





26
Microsoft Purview
DLP reports a vast amount of information to Microsoft Purview from monitoring policy matches and actions, to user activities. You need to consume and act on that information to tune your policies and triage actions taken on sensitive items. The telemetry goes into the Microsoft 365 audit Logs first, is processed, and makes its way to different reporting tools.





27
Microsoft Purview
DLP policies can be applied to the following locations:
    Exchange online email
    SharePoint sites
    OneDrive accounts
    Teams chat and channel messages
    Windows 10, 11 and macOS Devices
    Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
    On-premises repositories





28
Microsoft Purview
Microsoft Purview comes with preconfigured DLP templates for Financial, Medical and health, and Privacy policy templates. Additionally, you can build your own using the Custom template. As you design and create your actual DLP policies, having a working knowledge of the sensitive items you need to protect helps you choose the right sensitive information type.

Power BI
How does ALLEXCEPT work in a measure?
ALLEXCEPT(table, column1, …) removes all filters on the specified table except those on the listed columns. It’s used inside CALCULATE to preserve only certain filters (for example, keep EngagementID but ignore Task Category).





72
Power BI
Q: Why is a 200 K-row table (40 MB PBIX) unlikely to be “too large” for Power BI Desktop?
A: Power BI regularly handles multi-million-row tables under 100 MB if well-modeled; a 200 K-row table is small. Performance issues usually stem from query complexity or broken folding, not raw size.





73
Power BI
Q: What is VertiPaq and why is it relevant when appending tables?
A: VertiPaq is Power BI’s in‐memory columnar engine. When appending tables with identical schemas, VertiPaq compresses and merges columns efficiently, making the in‐memory append step very fast.





74

75
Power BI
Why might SUMMARIZECOLUMNS yield better performance than SUMMARIZE?
The Tabular engine has built-in optimizations for SUMMARIZECOLUMNS that reduce temporary table materializations and merge identical aggregations, resulting in faster query plans, especially on large fact tables.





76
Power BI
What’s the difference between SUMMARIZE and SUMMARIZECOLUMNS?
SUMMARIZE creates a virtual table using a row context that you must convert to filter context with CALCULATE, whereas SUMMARIZECOLUMNS works directly in filter context, handles aggregations and filter modifiers more predictably, and is optimized by the engine for better performance.





77
Power BI
Q: What role does Data Profiling in Power Query play when troubleshooting refresh issues?
A:

    Data Profiling (enable under View → Column quality/Column distribution) lets you see values, error rates, and distinct counts.

    Helps identify unexpected nulls, data type mismatches, or outliers that could increase transformation complexity or break folding.

82
Python + Oauth2.0
handler.send_response()

Sends an HTTP status code back to the client (browser). For example, `handler.send_response(200)` indicates success, while `handler.send_response(400)` signals a bad request.
handler is an instance of OAuthHandler, which inherits from http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler





83
Python + Oauth2.0

Exchange Online and Defender
HELO is simple: it only introduces the client.
    It does not provide a mechanism for the client to learn about server features such as STARTTLS, AUTH, SIZE, or other ESMTP extensions.
    Those are only available via EHLO.





181
Exchange Online and Defender
If you're using the *.onmicrosoft.com domain for email (also known as the Microsoft Online Email Routing Address or MOERA domain), there's not nearly as much for you to do: 

SPF and DKIM are configured automatically
DMARC still needs to be manually set up via DNS records.





182
Exchange Online and Defender
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM): DKIM signs outbound messages and stores the signature in the message header that survives message forwarding.





183
Exchange Online and Defender
Authenticated Received Chain (ARC): If a non-Microsoft service modifies inbound messages before delivery to Microsoft 365, you can identify the service as a trusted ARC sealer (if the service supports it). Trusted ARC sealers preserve unmodified email information so the modified messages don't automatically fail email authentication checks in Microsoft 365.





184
Exchange Online and Defender
HELO is required for legacy/standard SMTP (non‑ESMTP)
    Every SMTP server that follows the basic SMTP specification must support HELO.
    It is the minimal handshake required before any mail transaction can proceed.
    If a server does not support ESMTP extensions, HELO—not EHLO—will be used.

Azure Files Documentation
You can perform both item-level and share-level restores in the Azure portal using Azure Backup. All you need to do is choose the restore point (a particular snapshot), the particular file or directory if relevant, and then the location (original or alternate) you wish you restore to.





197
Azure Files Documentation
Soft delete is a storage-account level setting that allows you to recover your file share when it's accidentally deleted. When a file share is deleted, it transitions to a soft deleted state instead of being permanently erased. You can configure the amount of time soft deleted shares are recoverable before they're permanently deleted.





198
Azure Files Documentation
If a machine isn't domain joined, you can still use AD DS for authentication if the machine has unimpeded network connectivity to the on-premises AD domain controller and the user provides explicit credentials. For more information, see Mount the file share from a non-domain-joined VM or a VM joined to a different AD domain.





199
Azure Files Documentation
Azure Files supports identity-based authentication for Windows file shares over Server Message Block (SMB) using the Kerberos authentication protocol through the following methods:

    On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
    Microsoft Entra Domain Services
    Microsoft Entra Kerberos for hybrid user identities





200
Azure Files Documentation
When using AD DS authentication, you assign share-level permissions to hybrid identities synced to Microsoft Entra ID while managing file/directory-level access using Windows ACLs.





201
Azure Files Documentation
To assign share-level RBAC permissions to specific users or groups, on-premises AD DS identities must be synced to Microsoft Entra ID using Entra Connect Sync. If identities aren't synced, you must use a default share-level permission, which applies to all authenticated users





202
Azure Files Documentation
Use of different clients, SMB versions, firewall rules, ISPs, or IT policies can affect connectivity to Azure Files. Good news is AzFileDiagnostics isolates and examines each source of possible issues and in turn provides you with advice or workarounds to correct the problem.

All Microsoft Purview accounts, by default, start with one capacity unit and elastically grow based on usage. Each data Map capacity unit includes a throughput of 25 operations/sec and 10 GB of metadata storage limit.





216
Microsoft Purview
You can apply just one sensitivity label to an item such as a document, email, or container. If you use the option that requires your users to provide a justification for changing a label to a lower sensitivity for files, emails, and meetings, the order of this list identifies the lower sensitivity.





217
JavaScript Concepts
To create a deep copy of an object in JavaScript, you can use the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object)) method. This approach works well for simple objects, such as those with string:number pairs, and ensures that the original object remains unmodified.





218
JavaScript Concepts
Macrotask (Task) Queue
Also called the “callback queue.” Holds callbacks from things like setTimeout, I/O events, and UI rendering.





219
JavaScript Concepts
Type Coercion to boolean commonly occurs for
    the condition of an if statement
    the first operand of the ternary operator ?
    the operand of the logical NOT operator !
    the operands of the logical AND && and OR || operators (the result of the expression is one of the operands, not necessarily a boolean)





220
JavaScript Concepts
In many cases, it makes sense to assign a more appropriate default value than undefined. This can be done by specifying default parameters directly in the function definition.

function someName(param1 = defaultValue1, param2 = defaultValue2) {
  // ...
}





221
JavaScript Concepts
Microtask Queue
Holds promise callbacks (.then, .catch, .finally) and process.nextTick in Node.js. Microtasks always run before the next macrotask.





222
JavaScript Concepts
For objects, by default String returns an unhelpful text.

String({ key: 'value' });
// => '[object Object]'





223
JavaScript Concepts
Key-Value Pairs: Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs. Each key is a string (or symbol) and each value can be any data type, including other objects2.

Power BI
Q: What is “query folding” and why does it matter for refresh timeouts?
A: Query folding means pushing filtering/sorting logic down to the data source. If a step breaks folding, Power Query pulls all rows client-side, increasing data volume and risking timeouts.





260
Power BI
Q: Name one alternative to the SQL connector when connecting to Dataverse that can improve folding and avoid timeouts.
A: Use the built-in Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector via Get Data → Dataverse. It often auto-folds better into Dataverse’s paging model than the SQL (TDS) endpoint.





261
Power BI
Q: How do incremental refresh policies handle late-arriving data, and what can you do to mitigate missed updates?
    A:

    Incremental refresh typically uses a RangeStart/RangeEnd window; any rows older than RangeStart aren’t re-queried.

    To capture late-arriving updates, include a “stale data window” (e.g., overlapping dates) so you reprocess recent partitions that might receive back‐dated changes, then drop duplicates in Power Query or DAX.





262
Power BI
What’s the scope of variables (VAR) inside an ADDCOLUMNS column definition?
A VAR declared inside one column’s definition lives only within that column. To share results, you must either repeat the logic or separate the columns into multiple ADDCOLUMNS calls so that the column values exist in the table.





263
Power BI
Q: What indicates a break in query folding when reviewing Query Diagnostics in Power Query?
A: In the “Folding” diagnostic table, any step marked “Not foldable” shows where folding stopped, meaning subsequent transformations happen client‐side.





264
Power BI
What is the difference between row context and filter context in DAX?
Row context iterates over rows (as in iterators like SUMX or SUMMARIZE), while filter context filters tables for evaluation (as in measures and visuals). CALCULATE is the primary way to convert row context into filter context and apply or modify filters.





265
Power BI
When would you use GENERATESERIES in DAX?
GENERATESERIES(start, end, increment) produces a single-column table of numeric values at the specified step size. It’s useful for creating bins or ranges (for example, percentage buckets) for frequency analysis.





266
Python + Oauth2.0
handle_request()

A method of `TCPServer` that waits for a single incoming request and then processes it using the specified handler class. It’s used here to catch the OAuth redirect containing the authorization code.





267
Python + Oauth2.0
auth_request_url

269
Python + Oauth2.0
Authorization Code Flow

An OAuth 2.0 process where the user logs in via a browser, and the app receives a temporary code that it can exchange for an access token. This flow is secure because the client secret is never exposed during the initial login.





270
Python + Oauth2.0
handler.wfile.write()

Writes a response back to the browser window. In this script, it sends a simple message like “You may close this window” after the code is received.

Q:
Which itertools function can be used to create an iterator that returns elements from the first iterable until it is exhausted, then proceeds to the next iterable?

A:
itertools.chain().





367
Python
from functools import wraps

def my_decorator(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Pre-processing
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        # Post-processing

    return wrapper





368
Python
Q:
How does using yield from affect the performance of a generator?

A:
yield from can improve performance by delegating part of the generator’s operations to another generator, reducing overhead and simplifying code.

Example:
def generator1():
    yield from range(1000)

def generator2():
    yield from generator1()

# More efficient delegation





369
Python
Q:
What is the difference between itertools.accumulate() and itertools.reduce()?

A:
itertools.accumulate() returns an iterator that yields accumulated sums (or results of a specified function), while functools.reduce() applies a function cumulatively to the items of a sequence, reducing it to a single value.

Azure Files Documentation
The set of message packets that defines a particular version of the protocol is called a dialect. The Common Internet File System (CIFS) Protocol is a dialect of SMB. Both SMB and CIFS are also available on VMS, several versions of Unix, and other operating systems.





371
Azure Files Documentation
You can back up your Azure file share via share snapshots, which are read-only, point-in-time copies of your share. Snapshots are incremental, meaning they only contain as much data as has changed since the previous snapshot. You can have up to 200 snapshots per file share and retain them for up to 10 years.





372
Azure Files Documentation
Azure File Sync enables you to centralize your organization's file shares in Azure Files, while keeping the flexibility, performance, and compatibility of an on-premises file server. Azure File Sync transforms an on-premises (or cloud) Windows Server into a quick cache of your SMB Azure file share.

Azure Files Documentation
Pay-as-you-go storage accounts are distinguished using the StorageV2 storage account kind. 
They allow you to deploy file shares on HDD based hardware. 
They can be used to store classic file shares and other storage resources such as blob containers, queues, or tables.





375
Azure Files Documentation
Many important settings, such as network and security rules, are applied at the storage account level. You should consider the storage account to be a trust boundary and only place classic file shares in the same storage account if you're ok with them having the same security settings.





376
Azure Files Documentation
Azure Backup for Azure file shares handles the scheduling and retention of snapshots. Its grandfather-father-son (GFS) capabilities mean that you can take daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly snapshots, each with their own distinct retention period.

JavaScript Concepts
Front: What are tagged templates and how do you use them?

Back: Tagged templates allow you to parse template literals with a function. The function receives the template string and the values as arguments.
  function tag(strings, ...values) {
  console.log(strings); // Array of string segments
  console.log(values);  // Array of values
  return 'Tagged template result';
}
const result = tag`Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(result); // Output: Tagged template result

  async function foo() { … }





395
JavaScript Concepts
Unique Names: All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names, called identifiers. These names can be short (like x and y) or more descriptive (like age, sum, totalVolume). Identifiers can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but they must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign1.





396
JavaScript Concepts
Front: Can you nest string templates within each other?
Back: Yes, you can nest string templates within each other.
  const name = 'Jay';
  const nestedTemplate = `Hello, ${`dear ${name}`}!`;
  console.log(nestedTemplate); // Output: Hello, dear Jay!





397
JavaScript Concepts
With Boolean(value) you can convert any value to a boolean. There is a fixed set of values, so called falsy values, that convert to false. Most importantly, false, 0, empty string, null, undefined and NaN are falsy.
Boolean(-1);// => true
Boolean(0);// => false
Boolean(' ');// => true
Boolean('');// => false

Terraform Codebox
Azure File Share Mount in Linux
A process that connects a VM to an Azure Files storage account using the CIFS protocol. It's commonly mounted at boot time using cloud-init and allows persistence across VM reboots or tear-downs.





399
Terraform Codebox
Output values expose key info (like public IPs) after apply. They can be used to chain modules or help humans connect to deployed infrastructure.


hcl
output "ip" {
  value = azurerm_public_ip.this.ip_address
}





400
Terraform Codebox
The cloud-init mechanism in Azure allows Terraform to provision the VM on first boot, such as installing software, mounting storage, or configuring files.

Example inside VM block:

hcl
custom_data = base64encode(templatefile("${path.module}/cloud-init.yaml.tpl", {...}))





401
Terraform Codebox
The .terraform/ directory stores provider binaries and module cache for your Terraform project. It should never be committed to version control, as it may contain large files or local-only paths.





402
Terraform Codebox
.gitignore is used to tell Git which files or folders not to track. In Terraform projects, this prevents large or sensitive files like .terraform/ and .tfstate from being added accidentally.


markdown
.terraform/
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*





403
Terraform Codebox
Data sources in Terraform let you read existing cloud resources without managing them. You use them when you want to reference things created outside of Terraform.


hcl
data "azurerm_client_config" "current" {}





404
Terraform Codebox
Cloud-init is a standard way to initialize Linux VMs. Azure reads the custom_data field during VM provisioning and runs your script on first boot.

414
Active Directory and Azure Files
Azure Private Endpoint
A network interface in your VNet that maps a private IP to a PaaS resource. For Azure Files, it’s how on-prem clients connect securely without relying on public 445.





415
Active Directory and Azure Files
Security Identifier (SID)
A unique, immutable identifier for an AD object. Used internally by Windows for access control. You’ll need the SID of the Azure Files computer account for Terraform.





416
Active Directory and Azure Files
Azure Entra ID Kerberos (AAD Kerberos)
A newer model where Entra ID itself issues Kerberos tickets. Removes dependency on on-prem AD DS but behaves slightly differently.





417
Active Directory and Azure Files
Discretionary ACL (DACL)
Defines who is allowed or denied access. The type you’ll be working with when setting NTFS permissions on Azure Files.





418
Active Directory and Azure Files
DNS in AD
AD-integrated DNS zones store the records that let clients locate DCs (_kerberos._tcp, _ldap._tcp). Without this, Kerberos won’t work.

Power BI
Q: What are the risks of using a static RangeStart parameter over a long period?
A: If you never update RangeStart, new “late-arriving” or back‐dated changes older than that date won’t be captured. You risk permanently missing updates unless you periodically advance the boundary.





434
Power BI
Q: What is the typical Power BI Service behavior when you define an Incremental Refresh policy but deploy to a Pro workspace?
A: The service ignores the policy and performs a full‐table refresh each time, without partitioning.





435
Power BI
Q: What is the effect of data type mismatches on Power Query folding and performance?
    A:

    If you change a column’s data type (e.g., from text to date) before filtering, Power Query may break folding because the source might not support that conversion natively.

    Always apply type conversions at the end, after filters, or ensure the source can natively convert the type in the same query.





436
Power BI
Q: Why might switching to the Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector improve performance over the SQL connector?
A: The Dataverse connector is designed to leverage server‐side paging and API optimizations, often preserving query folding more reliably and avoiding TDS‐related throttling.

runuser vs sudo vs su

sudo: Run a command as another user (usually root) with elevated privileges.

su: Switches to another user session entirely.

runuser: Preferred in scripts and cloud-init to run a single command as another user without opening a full session.





553
Terraform Codebox
Terraform modules allow you to organize and reuse code. You can define a VM, network, or storage module once and use it in multiple places with different variables passed in.

Example root call:

hcl
module "ephemeral" {
  source = "./modules/ephemeral"
  vm_name = "devbox"
}





554
Terraform Codebox
SSH keys are used to securely authenticate to a VM. Terraform expects you to pass the public key path and inject it into the VM at creation, enabling key-based access instead of passwords.

Example in variables.tf:

hcl
variable "ssh_public_key_path" {
  default = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
}





555
Terraform Codebox

You can use auditing solutions in Microsoft Purview to track changes made to your Exchange Online configuration by Microsoft and by your organization's administrators, and to audit mailbox access by persons other than the mailbox owner.





621
Exchange Online and Defender
A valid, consistent HELO value affects deliverability
    Receiving servers often inspect the HELO identity as a hygiene and reputation signal.
    A mismatch, nonexistent domain, or generic hostname (e.g., localhost) can contribute to spam classification or rejection.
    While DMARC does not directly use HELO, SPF checks can, and mailbox providers use its validity as a trust indicator.

Azure Files Documentation
To enable AD DS authentication over SMB for Azure file shares, you need to register your Azure storage account with your on-premises AD DS and then set the required domain properties on the storage account. To register your storage account with AD DS, you create a computer account (or service logon account) representing it in your AD DS.





742
Azure Files Documentation
Classic file shares, and the child objects for other storage services like blob containers, that live within the same storage account share a common pool of storage, IOPS, and throughput. This means placing multiple classic file shares in a storage account requires planning to avoid capacity bottlenecks





743
Azure Files Documentation
Enabling AD DS authentication for your Azure file shares allows you to authenticate to your Azure file shares with your on-premises AD DS credentials. Further, it allows you to better manage your permissions to allow granular access control.





744
Azure Files Documentation
The Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) is integrated with other Windows Server security services that run on the domain controller. The KDC uses the domain's Active Directory Domain Services database as its security account database. Active Directory Domain Services is required for default Kerberos implementations within the domain or forest.

When viewed by users in your organization, an applied sensitivity label appears like a tag on apps and can be easily integrated into their existing workflows. Your sensitivity labels aren't visible in apps to users from other organizations, or to guests.





750
Microsoft Purview
Publish the labels. After your sensitivity labels are configured, publish them by using a label policy. Decide which users and groups should have the labels and what policy settings to use. A single label is reusable—you define it once, and then you can include it in several label policies assigned to different users.

SMB Multichannel enables clients to use multiple network connections that provide increased performance while lowering the cost of ownership. Increased performance is achieved through bandwidth aggregation over multiple NICs and utilizing Receive Side Scaling (RSS) support for NICs to distribute the I/O load across multiple CPUs.





760
Azure Files Documentation
You can access your Azure file shares over the public internet accessible endpoint, over one or more private endpoints on your network(s), or by caching your Azure file share on-premises with Azure File Sync (SMB file shares only).





761
Azure Files Documentation
SMB Multichannel enables an SMB client to establish multiple network connections to an SMB file share. Azure Files supports SMB Multichannel on SSD file shares for Windows clients. On the service side, SMB Multichannel is now enabled by default for all newly created storage accounts in all Azure regions. There's no extra cost for enabling SMB Multichannel.

Back: From the project root, invoke it with python -m package_name.module_name.





763
Python
Front: How do you perform a relative import from a child module to a parent module in a package?
Back: Use syntax like from ..parent_pkg import parent_module (with __init__.py files marking each package level).





764
Python
Q:
Why should you prefer sys.exit() over exit() in production scripts?

A:
sys.exit() is more explicit and is the standard way to exit scripts, while exit() is intended for interactive shells and may not behave as expected in all environments.





765
Python
What does the any() function do when used with a generator expression?

A:
It returns True if any element of the generator is True, otherwise False. It evaluates elements lazily and stops as soon as a True is found.

Example:
result = any(x > 10 for x in gen())





766
Python
Front: What’s the minimal notebook-friendly workaround to import a script from a non-package folder?
Back:

python
>>>
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, r"C:\path\to\Retain Integration")
from load_local_config import load_local_config





767
Python
Q:
How can you create mutually exclusive command-line arguments using argparse?

A:
By using the add_mutually_exclusive_group() method.

Example:
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
group = parser.add_mutually_exclusive_group()
group.add_argument('--add', action='store_true')
group.add_argument('--remove', action='store_true')
args = parser.parse_args()

Python
Q:
What are the two essential methods that an iterator class must implement?

A:
__iter__() and __next__().





770
Python
Forward References in Type Hints
Type hints can refer to classes not yet defined.
Solutions: quotes ("Node") or from __future__ import annotations.





771
Python
Q:
How can you memoize a generator function to cache its results?

A:
By using decorators like functools.lru_cache() on generator functions, although it's generally more suited for regular functions. For generators, you might need to implement custom caching.

Note:
functools.lru_cache() does not work directly with generator functions since they return iterators. Instead, consider converting the generator to a list and then caching.





772
Python
Path.resolve()
Converts a path into an absolute, normalized path.





773
Python
Pathlib (Path)
Modern replacement for os.path.
Supports intuitive operators (/ for joining paths), suffix checks, directory creation, and normalization with .resolve().





774
Python
Zip Slip (Path Traversal Attack)
Malicious zips can contain members like ../../etc/passwd.
Naïve extractall() writes outside the intended folder.
Fix: use Path.resolve() to normalize paths and ensure they remain within a safe directory.
