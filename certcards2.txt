Diffusers Library
Classifier-Free Guidance
A technique allowing diffusion models to generate images without an external classifier, enhancing flexibility in output. This guidance uses the model's own internal structure to fine-tune the output, improving realism without the need for additional label constraints.





2
Diffusers Library
Reverse Diffusion
The inverse process where an image is generated by removing noise, step-by-step, from an initial noisy state. This approach is essential in diffusion models, reconstructing data by "reversing" the diffusion process and achieving high-quality image outputs.





3
Diffusers Library
Forward and Reverse Processes
In diffusion, the forward process gradually adds noise to data, following a fixed probabilistic schedule, and the reverse process learns to denoise the noisy data. Mathematically, the forward process models q(x_t | x_{t-1}), while the reverse learns p(x_{t-1} | x_t) to reconstruct images.

I had a ticket with Lauren Kawamoto going back to 11/22/24 about her permissions in the sandbox. It turns out that she needed the "TS - Recur Engagement" role to recur engagements. I thought that "system administrator" would be enough, but I was not able to do that myself with the sysadmin role. Strange.

A search service runs one indexer job per search unit. If you need concurrent processing, make sure you have sufficient replicas. Indexers don't run in the background, so you might detect more query throttling than usual if the service is under pressure.





106
Azure AI Search
After the first indexer run, you can rerun it on demand or set up a schedule.

You can monitor indexer status in the Azure portal or through Get Indexer Status API. You should also run queries on the index to verify the result is what you expected.

118
SharePoint
SharePoint REST API adheres to REST (Representational State Transfer) principles, which means it uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs.





119
SharePoint
To access SharePoint resources using REST, construct a RESTful HTTP request by using the OData standard, which corresponds to the desired client object model API. For example:

GET https://{site_url}/_api/lists/getbytitle('{list_name}')/items
Authorization: "Bearer " + accessToken
Accept: "application/json;odata=verbose"

Logging in Python
Q: How can you configure Python's logging to output messages to a file instead of the console?

A: Use FileHandler from the logging module with a filename like 'app.log'.
This directs log messages to the specified file instead of the standard console output.





148
Logging in Python
Q: What does WatchedFileHandler from the logging.handlers module do differently compared to FileHandler?

A: It watches the log file for external modifications and automatically reopens it if the file is moved or deleted.
This is useful when external tools handle log rotation, ensuring continuous logging without interruption.





149
Logging in Python
Q: How can you configure multiple file handlers with different log levels for the same logger in Python's logging module?

A: Add multiple handlers to the logger, each with its own level and target file, such as one handler with level=INFO writing to 'info.log' and another with level=ERROR writing to 'error.log'.
This setup allows segregation of log messages based on severity levels across different files.

Azure AI Foundry
AI Foundry project: A project is a child resource of the hub. The Azure resource provider for a project is Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces, and the kind of resource is Project. The project provides the following features:
    Access to development tools for building and customizing AI applications.
    Reusable components including datasets, models, and indexes.
    An isolated container to upload data to (within the storage inherited from the hub).





309
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
The host network enables you to run the container on the host network directly. This configuration effectively removes the isolation between the host and the container at a network level.

Keep in mind that the container can use only ports the host isn't already using.





310
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A volume is stored on the host filesystem at a specific folder location. Choose a folder where you know the data won't be modified by non-Docker processes.

Docker creates and manages the new volume by running the docker volume create command. This command can form part of our Dockerfile definition, which means that you can create volumes as part of the container-creation process. Docker creates the volume if it doesn't exist when you try to mount the volume into a container the first time.

313
Azure AI Search
You can run indexers on demand or on a recurring data refresh schedule that runs as often as every five minutes. More frequent updates preclude the use of indexers, requiring that you implement a 'push model' that simultaneously pushes data to both Azure AI Search and your external data source.
