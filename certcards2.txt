Python
Augmented assignment operators provide a more concise way to update the value of a variable. For example, counter += 1 is a shorthand for counter = counter + 1.

These operators rely on special methods like .__iadd__() for in-place operations. If the data type is mutable, then Python performs the operation in place. If the data type is immutable, Python returns a new object with the updated value.




29
Python
The purpose of the .__init__() method in a Python class is to initialize instance attributes.

When you create an instance of a class, Python automatically calls .__init__() using the same arguments that you’ve passed to the constructor. This method sets up the initial state of the object by assigning values to instance attributes.

In Python, arithmetic operators are supported by corresponding magic methods. For example, the + operator is supported by .__add__(), and the - operator is supported by .__sub__().

These methods allow you to define custom behavior for these operators in your classes.




108
Python
>>> "Hello, {}! Today is {}.".format(name, day)
'Hello, Pythonista! Today is Friday.'

The method interpolates its arguments into the target string using replacement fields limited by curly brackets. Even though this method can produce hard-to-read code, it represents a significant advance over the modulo operator: it supports the string formatting mini-language.

Type hints in Python are purely optional and are not enforced by the Python interpreter. This means that adding type hints to your code does not affect its runtime behavior; they are used for static type checking, documentation, and code completion in development environments. Tools like mypy or integrated development environments (IDEs) can use these hints to catch type errors before runtime.

Once we've identified the shape of the trend, we can attempt to model it using a time-step feature. We've already seen how using the time dummy itself will model a linear trend:
target = a * time + b

We can fit many other kinds of trend through transformations of the time dummy. If the trend appears to be quadratic (a parabola), we just need to add the square of the time dummy to the feature set, giving us:
target = a * time ** 2 + b * time + c

Azure Functions
A trigger is an object that defines a specific function. For example, if you want a function to execute every 10 minutes, you could use a timer trigger.

Every function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to execute a piece of logic that runs under multiple conditions, you need to create multiple functions that share the same core function code.




249
Conditional Access
A persistent browser session allows users to remain signed in after closing and reopening their browser window. The Microsoft Entra ID default for browser session persistence allows users on personal devices to choose whether to persist the session by showing a “Stay signed in?” prompt after successful authentication.

Azure Functions




251
DNS
• DNS Sinkholing:
A defense mechanism where DNS queries for malicious domains are redirected to a controlled IP address (a sinkhole) to prevent users from accessing harmful content and to capture traffic for analysis.




252
Azure Storage
Replication: Determines the strategy used to make copies of your data to protect against hardware failure or natural disaster. At a minimum, Azure automatically maintains three copies of your data within the datacenter associated with the storage account. The minimum replication is called locally redundant storage (LRS), and guards against hardware failure but doesn't protect you from an event that incapacitates the entire datacenter.




253
Microsoft Fabric Administration
Admins can enable and disable global platform settings by controlling the Tenant settings. If your organization has one tenant, you can enable and disable settings for the entire organization from that tenant. Organizations with multiple tenants require an admin for each tenant




254
Power BI
By default, Query Diagnostics might require administrative rights to run (depending on IT policy). If you find yourself unable to run Query Diagnostics, open the Power BI options page, and in the Diagnostics tab, select Enable in Query Editor (does not require running as admin).




255
Azure Functions
Experimental APIs. If you use the Consumption plan, with Functions, you can make millions of calls and pay very little. One thing to keep in mind is that any type of storage incurs a cost.

An example is writing to a database with a function. This plan is ideal to use for prototyping or for Start-ups. In the latter case, if you have so many calls to your functions that most likely means you have paying customers. Hence, Azure Functions scales with your business. As your business grows, you might consider other hosting plans as well.




256
Azure Storage
Most Azure resources only work with Resource Manager, which makes it easy to decide which model to choose. However, storage accounts, virtual machines, and virtual networks support both, so you must choose one or the other when you create your storage account. The Resource Manager model adds the concept of a resource group, which isn't available in the classic model.




257
Power BI
In Power Query Diagnostics, 'Diagnose Step' is more useful for getting an insight into what evaluations are happening up to a single step, which can help you identify, up to that step, what performance is like as well as what parts of your query are being performed locally or remotely.

You can also assign users to roles by using PowerShell. Users are managed in Microsoft Graph PowerShell. If you don't already have the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, download and install the latest version.




261
Python
When declaring a function, follow arguments with a colon and the desired type to designate a required type for that argument. For example

def get_engagement_names(schedules: pd.DataFrame):
    engagement_names = [
        ' - '.join(row[['Account Name', 'EngagementName', 'Engagement Number']])
        for _, row in schedules.iterrows()
    ]
    engagement_names = "\n".join(engagement_names)
    return engagement_names




262
Python
The common practice is to use lists for homogeneous objects and tuples for heterogeneous objects. Lists are typically used when all elements are of the same type, while tuples are used when elements are of different types.




263
PP365
Engagements follow a Businesss Process flow. Business process flows provide a guide for people to get work done. They provide a streamlined user experience that leads people through the processes their organization has defined for interactions that need to be advanced to a conclusion of some kind.




264
Azure Functions
HTTP triggers let you use API keys to block unknown callers by requiring a key as part of the request. When you create a function, you select the authorization level. By default, it's set to Function, which requires a function-specific API key. It can also be set to Admin to use a global "master" key, or Anonymous to indicate that no key is required. You can also change the authorization level through the function properties after creation.




265
DNS
• DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions):
A suite of extensions to DNS that add a layer of security by enabling DNS responses to be cryptographically signed, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the DNS data.




266

272
Azure Functions
Serverless workflow. A series of functions can be chained together, and you can introduce state which makes it possible to devise complex long running workflows via Durable Functions. Another choice for workflows is Logic apps that can monitor external events, perform branching logic and invoke functions as a result.




273
DNS
• DNS over HTTPS (DoH):
A protocol that encrypts DNS queries using HTTPS, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks, and ensuring privacy of DNS traffic.




274
Conditional Access
Conditional Access: Client certificates can be used in conditional access policies to control access based on device compliance. This adds an extra layer of security by ensuring that only compliant devices can access sensitive data.




275
PP365
You can set a sandbox, production, or trial (subscription-based) environment in administration mode so that only users with System Administrator or System Customizer security roles will be able to sign in to that environment. Administration mode is useful when you want to make operational changes and not have regular users affect your work, and not have your work affect end users (non-admins).




276
Azure Storage
A storage account is a container that groups a set of Azure Storage services together. Only data services from Azure Storage can be included in a storage account (Azure Blobs, Azure Files, Azure Queues, and Azure Tables). The following illustration shows a storage account containing several data services.

Git
git rebase: This command reapplies commits on top of another base tip. It's used to keep a linear project history.




279
Python
In Python, special methods support comparison operators.

For example, the .__lt__() method supports the < operator, .__gt__() supports >, and the .__eq__() method supports the == operator.

These methods allow you to define custom behavior for comparison operations in your custom classes.




280
Python
Named replacement fields allow you to insert values from a dictionary into a string by using keys. This method is more readable and intuitive than using positional arguments with tuples.

Power BI
If there are data sources being accessed within the partition, and data flowing in from other partitions, the Firewall loses its ability to be the gatekeeper, since the data flowing in could be leaked to one of the internally accessed data sources without it knowing about it. Thus the Firewall prevents a partition that accesses other partitions from being allowed to directly access any data sources.
