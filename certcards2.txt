Fields is a collective term that is used to describe a model resource that can be used to configure a visual. The three different model resources that are fields include:

Columns
Hierarchy levels
Measures

In Azure Analysis Services, the compatibility level refers to release-specific behaviors in the Analysis Services engine. For example, DirectQuery and tabular object metadata have different implementations depending on the compatibility level. In-general, you should choose the latest compatibility level supported by your platform.

On the Home tab on the Power Query Editor ribbon, select the drop-down list for Append Queries. You can select Append Queries as New, which means that the output of appending will result in a new query or table, or you can select Append Queries, which will add the rows from an existing table into another.

A best practice is to evaluate the column data types in Power Query Editor before you load the data into a Power BI data model. If you determine that a data type is incorrect, you can change it. You might also want to apply a format to the values in a column and change the summarization default for a column.

 What can you do to improve performance when you're getting data in Power BI? 

Remove unnecessary columns and rows
Correct. Always use the least amount of data needed for your project.

Microsoft Data Analyst
In an Analytic Query, Summarizing produces a single value result. Typically, numeric columns are summarized by using summarization methods (sum, count, and many others). More complex summarizations, like a percent of grand total, can be achieved by defining measures that are written in DAX.

In an Analytic Query, filtering, or slicing, targets the data of relevance. In Power BI reports, filters can be applied to three different scopes: the entire report, a specific page, or a specific visual. Filtering is also applied in the background when row-level security (RLS) is enforced.

It's good practice to change uncommon or unhelpful query names to names that are more obvious or that the user is more familiar with. For instance, if you import a view, the view might have a name that contains a prefix of v, such as vProduct. People might find this name unclear and confusing, so you might want to remove the prefix.

A fiscal year is a period of 12 consecutive months chosen by a business or organization for financial reporting purposes. It may or may not correspond to a calendar year. For example, a company might choose to have its fiscal year begin on July 1 and end on June 30 of the following year.

2. If you have two queries that have different data but the same column headers, and you want to combine both tables into one query with all the combined rows, which operation should you perform? 

Append
  Correct. Append will take two tables and combine it into one query. The combined query will have more rows while keeping the same number of columns.
Merge
Combine Column

Some organizations use fiscal years for tax purposes. For example, the federal government's fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. This means that when the government passes its annual budget, it is for the upcoming fiscal year, not the upcoming calendar year.

A progress bill is a credit against WIP. The progress bill amount appears on the client’s invoice but does not relieve any WIP. Instead, it adds to the client’s balance due. When you finally bill the client’s WIP, you will apply the progress amount against the WIP to reach the net balance due.

You develop a Power BI model in Power BI Desktop, and once published to a workspace in the Power BI service, it’s then known as a dataset. A dataset is a Power BI artifact that’s a source of data for visualizations in Power BI reports and dashboards.






2
Microsoft Data Analyst
Not all datasets originate from models developed in Power BI Desktop. Some datasets represent connections to external-hosted models in AAS or SSAS. Others can represent real-time data structures, including push datasets, streaming datasets, or hybrid datasets. This module is concerned only with models developed in Power BI Desktop.

Table storage mode settings determine the model framework, which can be either import, DirectQuery, or composite. The following units in this module describe each of these frameworks and provides guidance on their use.

An import model comprises tables that have their storage mode property set to Import.
A DirectQuery model comprises tables that have their storage mode property set to DirectQuery, and they belong to the same source group. Source group is described later in this module.
A composite model comprises more than one source group.

Power BI imposes limits on how often scheduled refresh operations can occur. It’s up to eight times per day in a shared capacity, and up to 48 times per day in a dedicated capacity.






5
Microsoft Data Analyst
Power BI imposes dataset size restrictions, which limit the size of a model. When you publish the model to a shared capacity, there’s a 1-GB limit per dataset. When this size limit is exceeded, the dataset will fail to refresh. 



6
Microsoft Data Analyst
When you publish an import model to a dedicated capacity (also known as Premium capacities), it can grow beyond 10-GB, providing you enable the Large dataset storage format setting for the capacity.

By default, to refresh a table, Power BI removes all data and reloads it again. These operations can place an unacceptable burden on source systems, especially for large fact tables. To reduce this burden, you can set up the incremental refresh feature. Incremental refresh automates the creation and management of time-period partitions, and intelligently update only those partitions that require refresh.

Microsoft Data Analyst
An import model and a DirectQuery model only comprise a single source group. When there’s more than one source group, the model framework is known as a composite model.

Microsoft Data Analyst
DirectQuery is also useful when the source database enforces row-level security (RLS). Instead of replicating RLS rules in your Power BI model, the source data base can enforce its rules. This approach works only for some relational databases, and it involves setting up single sign-on for the dataset data source. For more information, see Azure SQL Database with DirectQuery.

To assist in the upgrade experience, at launch, there is a new clone feature that is now available on bots built using Power Virtual Agents (classic).
This feature will clone the selected Power Virtual Agents classic bot and create a new bot that uses the latest unified authoring version

Conversation Start: Previously, Bot makers had to customize the bot with additional code to automatically begin a conversation with Power Virtual Agents. This is no longer required, and the Conversation Start system topic begins the conversation automatically and is turned on by default today.

In Power Virtual Agents unified authoring release, you can now send an entire Object, whether that be a Dataverse record or a collection of Dataverse records, to send back using the text output of the Power Virtual Agents return statement.

Dataverse lets you securely store and manage data that's used by business applications. Data within Dataverse is stored within a set of tables. A table is a set of rows (formerly referred to as records) and columns (formerly referred to as fields/attributes). 




5
Power Virtual Agents
As a result of the new authoring capabilities in Power Virtual Agent, a bot author/maker can then retrieve that object from Power Automate, use the parse node feature and using the new variable features to extract the information from that object and format it as required (for example, within a custom Adaptive Card)

It is now possible to view and edit the YAML file that defines a specific topic by switching to code view. Changes should update in real time, but this paragraph I'm reading is a mess, so I'm not sure on that last bit.

Application Insights is an extension of Azure Monitor and provides application performance monitoring (APM) features. APM tools are useful to monitor applications from development, through test, and into production in the following ways:

Proactively understand how an application is performing.
Reactively review application execution data to determine the cause of an incident.




8
Power Virtual Agents
Within Power Virtual Agents, administrators can connect their Power Virtual Agent bot to an instance of Application Insights within the settings area using a connection string, and specify to log incoming and outgoing messages, whether or not to log sensitive activity properties and node actions by default.

You can add user-defined aggregation tables to a DirectQuery model. User-defined aggregation tables are special model tables that are hidden (from users, calculations, and RLS). They work best when they satisfy higher-grain analytic queries over large fact tables. 




2
MS Data Analyst
A significant DirectQuery model limitation is that not all Power Query (M) transformations are possible because these queries must translate to native queries that are understood by source systems. So, for example, it’s not possible to use pivot or unpivot transformations.






3
MS Data Analyst
Relationships between tables from different source groups are known as limited relationships. A model relationship is limited when the Power BI can’t determine a “one” side of a relationship. Limited relationships may result in different evaluations of model queries and calculations.

MS Data Analyst
When you set up an import table with incremental refresh, you can enable the Get the latest data in real-time with DirectQuery option. By enabling this option, Power BI automatically creates a table partition that uses DirectQuery storage mode. In this case, the table becomes a hybrid table, meaning it has import partitions to store older data, and a single DirectQuery partition for current data. This is a Premium feature.

Choose the import model framework whenever possible. This framework offers you the most options, design flexibility, and delivers fast performance. Be sure to apply data reduction techniques to ensure that Power BI loads the least amount of data possible.

MS Data Analyst
 In Power BI Desktop, it’s always possible to convert a DirectQuery table to an import table. But it’s not possible to convert an import table to a DirectQuery table.

MS Data Analyst
Choose the composite model framework to:

  Boost the query performance of a DirectQuery model.
  Deliver near real-time query results from an import model.
  Extend a Power BI dataset (or AAS model) with additional data.
