OAuth2.0
To learn who the user is before redeeming an authorization code, it's common for applications to also request an ID token when they request the authorization code. This approach is called the hybrid flow because it mixes OIDC with the OAuth2 authorization code flow.




146
sklearn
When evaluating the resulting model it is important to do it on held-out samples that were not seen during the grid search process: it is recommended to split the data into a development set (to be fed to the GridSearchCV instance) and an evaluation set to compute performance metrics.




147
MS Identity Platform
OAuth versus OpenID Connect: The platform uses OAuth for authorization and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0, so the terminology and flow are similar between the two. You can even both authenticate a user (through OpenID Connect) and get authorization to access a protected resource that the user owns (through OAuth 2.0) in one request.

Python
.headers returns a dictionary-like object, allowing you to access header values by key. For example, to see the content type of the response payload, you can access "Content-Type":

>>> response.headers["Content-Type"]
'application/json; charset=utf-8'

There’s something special about this dictionary-like headers object, though. The HTTP specification defines headers as case-insensitive, which means that you’re able to access these headers without worrying about their capitalization:

PyTorch is based on Torch, a framework for doing fast computation that is written in C. Torch has a Lua wrapper for constructing models.

PyTorch wraps the same C back end in a Python interface. But it’s more than just a wrapper. Developers built it from the ground up to make models easy to write for Python programmers.




164
Python
Python fully supports arithmetic between ints and floats. It will convert narrower numbers to match their less narrow counterparts when used with the binary arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, and %). When division with /, // returns the quotient and % returns the remainder. Python considers ints narrower than floats. So, using a float in an expression ensures the result will be a float too. However, when doing division, the result will always be a float, even if only integers are used.

Azure AI Search
Scalar Quantization: Scalar Quantization reduces the precision of individual scalar values within vectors. This balances the trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy, optimizing the performance of vector-based searches while maintaining sufficient detail for effective search results.




209
Power BI
Handling Optional API Parameters: For more advanced API requests, parameters such as catalog, calculations, annual averages, and aspects can be added in the payload. These allow for more control over the data returned. Adding these parameters will depend on the API’s available options as per its documentation.




210
sklearn
RandomizedSearchCV implements a randomized search over parameters, where each setting is sampled from a distribution over possible parameter values. This has two main benefits over an exhaustive search:
A budget can be chosen independent of the number of parameters and possible values.
Adding parameters that do not influence the performance does not decrease efficiency.




211
Conditional Access
We need Microsoft Entra P1 or P2 licenses for each user to implement risk-based policies AND alerts in Microsoft Entra ID. These are not included in our current Windows Licenses (Business Premium).




212
Python
According to the HTTP specification, POST, PUT, and the less common PATCH requests pass their data through the message body rather than through parameters in the query string. Using Requests, you’ll pass the payload to the corresponding function’s data parameter.

data takes a dictionary, a list of tuples, bytes, or a file-like object.




213
OData
$orderby
The $orderby query option lets clients specify the order in which the data should be returned. For instance, you can use it to sort a list of entities in ascending or descending order based on specific properties, such as sorting products by price.




214
PP365
You can set a sandbox, production, or trial (subscription-based) environment in administration mode so that only users with System Administrator or System Customizer security roles will be able to sign in to that environment. Administration mode is useful when you want to make operational changes and not have regular users affect your work, and not have your work affect end users (non-admins).




215
MS Identity Platform
The parties in an authentication flow use bearer tokens to assure, verify, and authenticate a principal (user, host, or service) and to grant or deny access to protected resources (authorization). Bearer tokens in the Microsoft identity platform are formatted as JSON Web Tokens (JWT).




216
PP365
You can design business process flows that tie together the rows for up to five different tables into a single process so that people using the app can focus on the flow of their process rather than on which table they are working in. They can more easily navigate between related table rows.

222
Power BI
When a query is evaluated with the Firewall on, the Firewall divides the query and all its dependencies into partitions (that is, groups of steps). Anytime one partition references something in another partition, the Firewall replaces the reference with a call to a special function called Value.Firewall.




223
GitHub codespaces
The primary file in a dev container configuration is the devcontainer.json file. You can use this file to determine the environment of codespaces created for your repository. The contents of this file define a dev container that can include frameworks, tools, extensions, and port forwarding. The devcontainer.json file usually contains a reference to a Dockerfile, which is typically located alongside the devcontainer.json file.




224
sklearn
The cv_results_ attribute contains useful information for analyzing the results of a search. It can be converted to a pandas dataframe with df = pd.DataFrame(est.cv_results_). The cv_results_ attribute of HalvingGridSearchCV and HalvingRandomSearchCV is similar to that of GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, with additional information related to the successive halving process.

The graph output uses the DOT language, which is a machine-readable graph description language which originated in Graphviz. You can use the Graphviz dot command to present the resulting graph description as an image. There are also various third-party online graph rendering services which accept this format.




246
sklearn
Given enough time, K-means will always converge, however this may be to a local minimum. This is highly dependent on the initialization of the centroids. As a result, the computation is often done several times, with different initializations of the centroids. One method to help address this issue is the k-means++ initialization scheme, which has been implemented in scikit-learn (use the init='k-means++' parameter).




247
Power BI
If there are data sources being accessed within the partition, and data flowing in from other partitions, the Firewall loses its ability to be the gatekeeper, since the data flowing in could be leaked to one of the internally accessed data sources without it knowing about it. Thus the Firewall prevents a partition that accesses other partitions from being allowed to directly access any data sources.




248
UHero Requests
Custom Components (Angular):
Custom components are reusable blocks of code in frameworks like Angular that define new HTML elements. They encapsulate logic, styling, and behavior, making it difficult to scrape using traditional methods like targeting <table> or <div> tags.

General
Kurtosis measures the tails of a distribution, indicating how much of the data is concentrated in the extremes versus the center.




273
sklearn
By default, parameter search uses the score function of the estimator to evaluate a parameter setting. These are the sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score for classification and sklearn.metrics.r2_score for regression. For some applications, other scoring functions are better suited (for example in unbalanced classification, the accuracy score is often uninformative). An alternative scoring function can be specified via the scoring parameter of most parameter search tools.




274
Azure Functions
Functions are event driven. They run only in response to an event (called a "trigger"), such as receiving an HTTP request, or a message being added to a queue. You configure a trigger as part of the function definition. This approach simplifies your code by allowing you to declare where the data comes from (trigger/input binding) and where it goes (output binding). You don't need to write code to watch queues, blobs, hubs, and so on. You can focus purely on the business logic.




275
Python
The first bit of information that you can gather from Response is the status code. A status code informs you of the status of the request.

For example, a 200 OK status means that your request was successful, whereas a 404 NOT FOUND status means that the resource you were looking for wasn’t found. There are many other possible status codes as well to give you specific insights into what happened with your request.

313
Power BI
A warning with query diagnostics, as mentioned elsewhere, is that you'll see drastically different capabilities depending on the connector. For example, many ODBC based connectors won't have an accurate recording of what query is send to the actual backend system, as Power Query only sees what it sends to the ODBC driver.




314
Power BI
To define a column in Power BI (DAX) that takes the non-blank value between two existing columns, or remains blank if both are blank, you can use the COALESCE function. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

NewColumn = COALESCE([Column1], [Column2])

TorchText is part of the PyTorch ecosystem and is designed to handle text data for natural language processing tasks. It offers tools for managing data loading, applying text transformations, and integrating with datasets.

This library simplifies tasks like text classification and language modeling by making vocabulary creation and tokenization more straightforward.




321
Python
When you try to create an instance of a class that inherits from the Sequence abstract base class, but doesn’t implement .__getitem__() and .__len__(), then Python raises a TypeError:

The Sequence abstract base class requires that any class that inherits from it must implement the .__getitem__() and .__len__() methods.




322
Azure Functions 
Just like the other triggers we've seen so far, you can create a blob trigger in the Azure portal. Inside your Azure function, select Blob trigger from the list of predefined trigger types. Then, enter the logic that you want to execute when a blob is created or updated.

One setting that's important to understand is the Path. The Path tells the blob trigger which blob container to monitor to see if a blob is uploaded or updated. By default, the Path value is:

samples-workitems/{name}




323
Python
In Python, you can compare sequences of the same type. When comparing two sequences, the first 
non-equal
 value determines the outcome.

For example, consider the following lists:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
more_numbers = [1, 2, 2, 10, 20]
When you compare these lists, you’ll find that numbers is greater than more_numbers.

Azure AI Search
Comprehensive Data Enhancement: The enrichment pipeline can include various operations such as text extraction, translation, entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. These enhancements improve the quality and relevance of the indexed data, leading to better search outcomes.




325
Python
Augmented assignment operators provide a more concise way to update the value of a variable. For example, counter += 1 is a shorthand for counter = counter + 1.

These operators rely on special methods like .__iadd__() for in-place operations. If the data type is mutable, then Python performs the operation in place. If the data type is immutable, Python returns a new object with the updated value.




326
sklearn 
permutation_test_score: This function assesses model performance by computing a baseline distribution of scores via label permutation, creating a null hypothesis benchmark. Comparing the model’s score to this distribution reveals whether its performance is significant or due to random chance.




327
sklearn 
LeavePGroupsOut: This cross-validation technique splits data based on group labels, leaving out all data points with a specific group label in each fold. Useful for datasets with naturally grouped data, where each group should either entirely be in training or test sets.




328
sklearn
Neighbors-based classification is computed from a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point: a query point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives within the nearest neighbors of the point.




329
Azure Storage
A storage account represents a collection of settings like location, replication strategy, and subscription owner. You need one storage account for each group of settings that you want to apply to your data. The following illustration shows two storage accounts that differ in one setting (region); that one difference is enough to require separate storage accounts.

Kaggle
Once we've identified the shape of the trend, we can attempt to model it using a time-step feature. We've already seen how using the time dummy itself will model a linear trend:
target = a * time + b

We can fit many other kinds of trend through transformations of the time dummy. If the trend appears to be quadratic (a parabola), we just need to add the square of the time dummy to the feature set, giving us:
target = a * time ** 2 + b * time + c
