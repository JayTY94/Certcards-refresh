Page tooltips allow your report consumers to gain deeper insights quickly and efficiently from visuals. As its name suggests, a page tooltip is a report page that receives the filter context of the source element. In this way, they are closely related to drillthrough pages, with the difference being that the page tooltip overlays a small page of visuals.

Some organizations prefer not to use custom visuals for security or other reasons. Before you import custom visuals, check with your organization to see if they are allowed or not. If they are not allowed, you can instead use the Play Axis visual that is available for scatter chart visualizations within Power BI Desktop because it has similar functionality.

MS Data Analyst
Cross filtering (and cross highlighting) works between any two visuals. However, at design time, you can edit visual interactions between any pair of visuals and in either direction. Additionally, you can disable cross filtering or modify the interaction to use cross highlighting instead.

In the visual format options, you can enable the toolbar so that report consumers can use the export command. This command can export the paginated report in many different formats, including Microsoft Excel, PDF, Accessible PDF, CSV, PowerPoint, Microsoft Word, MHTML, and XML. Also, unlike the 150,000-row limitation that is imposed by Power BI reports, paginated reports can export up to 1,000,000 rows to Excel while retaining all formatting of the paginated report.

Report objects are laid out on each report page and include:

Visuals - Visualizations of semantic model data.

Elements - Provide visual interest but don't use semantic model data.

MS Data Analyst
Contrast can be used to combine two opposing objects. The use of contrasting colors, fonts, font properties, or lines can emphasize important objects of the report design. Use this principle to direct report consumers to where they should look or which data visual they should interact with first.





12
MS Data Analyst
The Tooltips section of a visual's Format Pane allows you to add a customized tooltip that appears when you hover over the visual, based on report pages that you create in Power BI Desktop. Tooltips is a great feature because it provides more contextual information and detail to data points on a visual. The default tooltip displays the data point's value and category, but your custom tooltips can include visuals, images, and any other collection of items that you create in the report page.

Advantages of Filters over Slicers
When the Apply button is enabled, you can submit all filter updates at once, resulting in fewer queries.

You can filter by using measures (only at visual level).

A report setting is available for you as the report author to disable all visual headers. When visual headers are disabled they will still be visible when editing the report, but they will be hidden for report consumers (in reading view). However, situations might occur where enabling this option is a good idea because it limits most interactions. It might make sense to disable visual interactions when you are delivering a Power BI report to an audience that's unfamiliar with Power BI or when you don't expect them to interact with the report.

Many DAX time intelligence functions are concerned with standard date periods, specifically years, quarters, and months. If you have irregular time periods (for example, financial months that begin mid-way through the calendar month), or you need to work with weeks or time periods (hours, minutes, and so on), the DAX time intelligence functions won't be helpful. Instead, you'll need to use the CALCULATE function and pass in hand-crafted date or time filters.





19

Beyond filters and slicers, report authors can employ other filtering techniques, such as:

Visual interactions
Drillthrough
Report tooltip
Bookmarks
Report options
Query reduction options

OLS is a feature inherited from Azure Analysis Services (AAS) and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). The feature is available in Power BI Premium to provide backward compatibility for models migrated to Power BI. For this reason, it’s not possible to completely set up OLS in Power BI Desktop.





21
MS Data Analyst
In the preceding example, when you applied clustering to the scatter chart, you could only use two measures. If you want to find clusters by using more than two measures, you can use a table visual instead, add all the fields you want to use, and then run the clustering algorithm by using the same process.





22

Visual headers - You can configure specific visuals to display a page tooltip. Your report users can reveal the page tooltip when they hover the cursor over the visual header icon. Make sure that you educate your users about this icon.





23
MS Data Analyst
The Current page state of a bookmark determines whether the bookmark will direct the report consumer to the bookmarked page or apply the current page. Disabling the Current page state is rare, but you should consider some creative use cases. For example, on a page tooltip, a bookmark can change the visuals without navigating from the page that the report consumer has selected.

By default, many visuals in Power BI are responsive, which means that they change dynamically to display the maximum amount of data and insight, regardless of the screen size. As a visual changes size, Power BI gives priority to the data and makes small changes, such as removing padding or repositioning the legend, so that the data remains visible.

Histograms and bell curves are the most common way to display statistics about your semantic models. In Power BI terms, you can represent a histogram with one of the bar or column chart visuals and represent a bell curve with an area chart visual.





29
MS Data Analyst
Line charts work well with a consistent flow of data, such as when sales are recorded for every period. If no sales are recorded for some periods, the line chart visual will fill such gaps with a straight line that connects the values of the previous and next periods. If missing values are a possibility, a column chart might be a better visual choice because it will help to avoid the interpretation of a non-existent trend.

Educational reports assume that the report consumer is unfamiliar with the data or context. So the reports must provide clear narrative detail and guidance to help with understanding. This type of report is often used in journalism and by governments to disseminate information to large audiences that have varying levels of understanding of the subject.





35
MS Data Analyst
As a data modeler, you set up RLS by creating one or more roles. A role has a unique name in the model, and it usually includes one or more rules. Rules enforce filters on model tables by using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) filter expressions.





36
MS Data Analyst
Knowing how your report consumers are likely interacting with reports should influence your report designs. Consider the number of visuals that display together on the page, the complexity of visuals, spacing between visuals, and the use of interactive design elements such as tooltips, slicers, buttons, or filters.





37
MS Data Analyst
Use color sparingly and meaningfully because overusing it can be distracting. Stick to a few softer colors as a base, possibly aligned with corporate colors. Softer colors ensure that the data is the focus in your report. Reserve the use of bolder colors to highlight exceptions.

Many Power BI visuals include a Tooltips well. Fields that are added to this well is summarized in a tooltip. For example, a column chart visual that shows sales revenue by month could include order quantity as a tooltip. While the height of the column reveals the monthly revenue amount, when a report consumer hovers over the column, a tooltip describes the order quantity for that month.

MS Data Analyst
Bookmark scope

Bookmarks can apply to all page visuals or specific visuals that you select. The All visuals scope is turned on by default, meaning that the bookmark applies to all report objects, even if hidden. The Selected Visuals scope will target only those visuals that are selected when the bookmark was updated.





41
MS Data Analyst
You can use conditional formatting to format table and matrix visuals. With this approach, you can apply rules to highlight specific cells by using:

Background color
Font color
Data bars
Icons





42
MS Data Analyst
You can create a bookmark to capture the default state of slicers. A button on the report page could have the text Reset slicers, and when invoked, it will use the bookmark.





43
MS Data Analyst
You can’t mix RLS and OLS in the same role. If you need to apply RLS and OLS in the same model, create separate roles dedicated to each type. Also, you can’t set table-level security if it breaks a relationship chain. For example, if there are relationships between tables A and B, and B and C, you can't secure table B.





44
MS Data Analyst
Create a bookmark to reset all slicers to default values. Then, add a button to the page to invoke the bookmark. For example, the button could be captioned as Reset slicers.

Visual headers might appear in the upper or lower part of the object. Power BI attempts to show visual headers in the upper right of the object if sufficient space is available between the upper part of the object and the edge of the page. If no space is available in the upper part, Power BI will place the visual headers in the lower-right corner of the visual.

Report consumers can include or exclude one or more groups in a visual. Include keeps the selection and removes all other groups. Exclude removes one or more groups from the visual.

These filters appear in the Filters pane as filter cards titled Included or Excluded. The report consumer can use the Filters pane to view, modify, or remove them.





51
MS Data Analyst
The simplest way to show details is to use drillable visuals. The matrix visual is an excellent choice because it allows drilling on rows and/or columns. Therefore, by assigning hierarchies or multiple fields, report consumers can drill to the level of detail that they want. For example, the matrix rows could show years, and the report consumer could drill down to quarter, month, and date levels.





52
MS Data Analyst
You can lock filters to ensure that report consumers can't remove or modify them. It's a good idea to lock filters that are critical to the design of the report, page, or visual. Additionally, you can hide filters. A hidden filter isn't visible to report consumers. Consider hiding a filter when the report consumer doesn't need to know about it, such as when filters are cleaning up the data, perhaps by removing BLANKs.





53
MS Data Analyst
The process of identifying outliers involves segmenting your data into two groups: one group is the outlier data and the other group is not. You could use calculated columns to identify outliers, but the results would be static until you refresh the data. A better way to identify outliers is to use a visualization or DAX formula because these methods will ensure that your results are dynamic.





54
MS Data Analyst
Dropdown slicer layouts are common; they help minimize the size of the slicer to provide more room on the page for other visuals. An additional benefit when using dropdown slicers that might not be immediately apparent is that they only query the semantic model when expanded open. Therefore, they can also help expedite report page rendering.





55
MS Data Analyst
Time intelligence calculations modify date filter contexts. They can help you answer these time-related questions:

• What's the accumulation of revenue for the year, quarter, or month?
• What revenue was produced for the same period last year?
What growth in revenue has been achieved over the same period last year?

Make sure that you include bookmark requirements in all design decisions. For optimal experiences, you should create bookmarks at the end of report development after you have added all report elements. This approach will help you avoid the complex and time-consuming updating of bookmarks when you're adding new elements.

If the Filter icon isn't available for a visual, it could be because:
	• The report settings disable visual headers for the entire report.
	• The visual settings disable the visual header for the visual.
The visual settings disable the visual header Filter icon for the visual.

The slicer layout is responsive to the data type of the field. Field data types are either text, numeric, or date. By default, a text field will produce a list slicer, a numeric field will produce a numeric range "between" filter, and a date field will produce a date range "between" filter, allowing value selection with calendar controls.





64
MS Data Analyst
The Advanced filter type allows you to create more complex conditions by using data type-specific operators:

Text field operators - Test for conditions such as "contains," "starts with," "is blank," "is empty," and others.
Numeric field operators - Test for conditions such as "is less than," "is less than or equal to," and others.
Date field operators - Test for conditions such as "is after," "is on or after," and others.

Balance can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. Symmetrical balance is achieved by distributing the weight evenly on both halves of the page. Asymmetrical balance is achieved through contrast.

Consider using the golden ratio as a guide to produce asymmetrical balance.

DAX Studio
The EVALUATE keyword is automatically included by Power BI in every query. It’s used to answer and create your visuals in Power BI. It’s also used to contain table expressions in a DAX query. You can’t pair EVALUATE with a scalar value such as a measure or a number. You can only use EVALUATE with table expressions.





68
DAX Studio
To convert numbers or measures into a table, you need to place it between curly brackets { }. To create a table with two columns, use parenthesis ( ) and write another value separated by a comma. To add another row, you need to place another expression within a parenthesis inside the curly bracket.





69
MS Data Analyst
Another important consideration when you are laying out report objects is balance. Balance is concerned with stability and structure in design. In the context of a report layout, balance refers to the weight that is distributed across the report page by the placement of objects of the same or different sizes.

MS Data Analyst
You can extend the core visuals with custom visuals. Custom visuals are sourced from Microsoft AppSource (an app store for business applications such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Power BI, or separate Microsoft Azure web apps) or uploaded as a .pbviz file.





71
MS Data Analyst
In the Data colors section of a visual's Format Pane, you can set the colors that you want to use for the data values in the visual. You can use different colors for different fields, but always try to be consistent when it comes to selecting those colors. It is best to use the same color scheme throughout the report.

Data engine cache - When a query is run, the results are cached, so the results of your analysis will be misleading. You need to clear the data cache before rerunning the visual.

To clear the data cache, you can either restart Power BI Desktop or connect DAX Studio to the semantic model and then call Clear Cache.

Report settings can:

Add an Apply button to all basic filters in the Filters pane. A single filter will apply when the report consumer selects the Apply button in the filter card.
Add an Apply button to the Filters pane. All filters will apply simultaneously when the report consumer selects the Apply button. This option is helpful when report consumers want to update many filters at the same time.

Margins include the border area, or edge, around each page. Having a consistently spaced border area frames the report objects.

Because there isn't a report page property to set margins, it's up to you to lay out objects in way that results in a consistent border area. Margin sizes should be equal on the left and right, with possible variation on the top and bottom. Space across the top or bottom can show branding, titles, slicers, or other information that needs to be separated from the visuals.





83

The Top N filter type applies to text and date fields that are available only in visual-level filters. This filter type helps you filter by the top (or bottom) number of items, like the top five products by revenue. To configure the filter, you must pass in a field that's summarized, like sales revenue.

The Drillthrough action is assigned a target drillthrough destination page. The button remains disabled until drillthrough becomes a valid action, which is the case when you are interacting with a visual that can navigate to the drillthrough page. When the Drillthrough action is selected, Power BI navigates to the drillthrough page, propagating appropriate filters.

The Data state captures anything that impacts the queries that Power BI sends to the semantic model. For example, if a slicer is included in the scope of the bookmark, the Data state retains the applied slicer items when the bookmark was created (or updated). It will also capture sort order and the drill depth of a visual because the query is impacted.

Occasionally, report consumers want to know (or verify) what filters, if any, apply to a specific visual. They can complete that action by hovering the cursor over the Filter icon in the visual header. A pop-up window will appear, describing the filters that affect the visual. The pop-up window shows the accumulation of filters that are applied by slicers or filters, including any cross filters.

You can hide pages when they're not yet ready for use; they're a work in progress. However, you might commonly hide them because you want to control how they're accessed. You can provide report page navigation with buttons or by drilling through from a visual. It's also possible to design a page as a tooltip, which is revealed when a report consumer hovers over a visual.

Rupali is a data modeler at Adventure Works who is developing an import model to analyze employee timesheet data. The employee table stores the employee social security number (SSN) in a column. While the model will be available for all company managers, it will also be available to employees in the Payroll department. However, reports must only reveal employee SSNs to payroll employees. What feature should Rupali use to restrict access to the SSN column? 

You can use OLS (object-level security) to secure the SSN column in the employee table.

Report authors can configure report or visual settings to control filter options and behavior. With report options, you can:

Disable persistent filters. (Persistent filters arecovered in unit 5.)
Hide visual headers for all visuals or for a specific visual. When the visual header is hidden, report consumers can't hover the cursor over the Filter icon to determine the filters that are applied to the visual. (The Filter icon is covered in Unit 5).

Another way to use tooltips is to display graphical information. The process of adding this type of tooltip is not as straightforward, but it is worthwhile. You would begin by creating a new page in the report.

Open the new page and then open the Format pane. Expand the Page Size section and then select Tooltip from the Type list.

In the Page information section, turn the Tooltip slider to On so that Power BI registers this page as a tooltip page

Tooltips have limited canvas space, so to ensure that your visuals appear in the tooltip, on the View tab, set the Page view option to Actual size.

On-hover formatting
You can configure buttons to change their state when a hover over is available. When the report consumer hovers the cursor over a button, the cursor icon changes to a pointing finger, which indicates that the button is selectable. In this example, the Tabular button text is light gray by default, but when they hover the cursor over, it darkens to black.

Disadvantages of Filters vs Slicers
The Filters pane offers less design flexibility, though you can style it by using specific fonts and colors.

To create the group, use Ctrl + click to select the data points on the visual that you want to group. For example, the states with sales greater than 500,000 dollars. Right-click one of those selected data points and then select the Group data option. When the group is created, notice that the visual updates to take into account the new group. The following image shows that the other states, which are the states with lower sales (less than 500,000 dollars) have been grouped together and are highlighted in a different shade.

Dynamic rules use specific DAX functions that return environmental values (as opposed to constants). Environmental values are returned from three specific DAX functions:

USERNAME or USERPRINCIPALNAME – Returns the Power BI authenticated user as a text value.

CUSTOMDATA - Returns the CustomData property passed in the connection string. Non-Power BI reporting tools that connect to the dataset by using a connection string can set this property, like Microsoft Excel.

The report theme should express your organizational branding or aim to complement it. At a minimum, the theme should include the following elements:

A brand mark or logo symbol.

A palette of colors that align to, or complement, organizational branding. The colors should also be sufficiently different so that, when applied to visuals, they provide appropriate contrast when appearing side by side.

Text settings, including font selection, sizes, and color.

When a requirement is in place to lay out many slicers, consider creating a page that is dedicated to showing all slicers. For example, the page could be named Slicers. Sync the slicers to other pages and then set the slicers as hidden on those pages. This design technique will require that report consumers should always go to the Slicers page to modify slicer settings.

The Relative date and Relative time filter types apply to date fields only, making it possible to filter by relative date or time. Relative filters allow the report consumer to filter by past, present, or future time periods based on the current date and time.

Create Visuals from Insights: When you use the Analyze feature to find insights, Power BI may suggest new visuals. You can add these suggested visuals directly to your report.

Customizing Suggested Visuals: Once a visual is suggested by the Analyze feature, you can further customize it. This includes changing the visual type, modifying data fields, applying filters, and adjusting formatting options.

The three main AI visuals are:
  Key influencers
  Decomposition tree
  Q&A

When adding an AI visual to your report, make sure that you size it to become as large as possible. That way, report consumers can fully interact with and explore the data in the visual.

The Key influencers visual helps report consumers understand the factors that drive a particular metric, like sales revenue. By using AI, Power BI will analyze the data, rank the factors that matter, and then present them as key influencers.

The Decomposition Tree visual helps report consumers visualize data across multiple dimensions. It automatically aggregates data and enables consumers to drill down into dimensions in any order. As a result, it's a valuable tool for ad hoc exploration and conducting root cause analysis. As an AI visual, a decomposition tree provides a guided exploration experience that helps by finding the next dimension for consumers to drill down into.

The Q&A visual allows report consumers to ask questions of their data and receive responses as data visualizations. Similar to how web search engines parse and understand complex search requests, report consumers can write natural language questions (in English).

If the Forecast section isn't available for a line chart, it’s probably because the visual hasn’t been correctly configured. Forecasting is only available when two conditions are met: the axis has a single field of type date, and there’s only one value field.

Power BI paginated reports are descendants of SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), which was first introduced in 2004. Power BI paginated reports and SSRS have a lot in common. If you're looking for information on paginated reports and can't find it, searching the internet and Microsoft documentation on SSRS is an excellent idea because you'll find numerous blog posts, videos, and documentation available to you.

Paginated reports give a pixel-perfect view of the data. Pixel perfect means that you have total control of how the report renders. If you want a footer on every sales receipt that you create, a paginated report is the appropriate solution. If you want a certain customer's name to always appear in green font on a report, you can do that in a paginated report.

Power BI paginated reports are not created in Power BI Desktop; they are built by using Power BI Report Builder. You can share paginated reports with either a Power BI Pro or a Power BI premium license.

Getting data in a Power BI paginated report does not involve data cleaning steps. In fact, data is not stored in a Power BI paginated report dataset. When data is refreshed on the report, it is retrieved in an unaltered form from the data source, according to the query that was used to retrieve it.

MS Data Analyst
Power BI paginated reports can use a dataset from Power BI service. These datasets have used Power Query to clean and alter the dat. The difference is that this work was done in Power BI Desktop or SQL Server Data Tools prior to using Power BI Report Builder, which does not have that tool in the user interface.
