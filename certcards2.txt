In HCL, Blocks are containers for other content and usually represent the same kind of object, like a source. Blocks have a block type, can have zero or more labels, and have a body that contains any number of arguments and nested blocks. Most of Packer's features are controlled by top-level blocks in a configuration file.

Terraform
Terraform expects that each remote object is bound to a single resource address. You should import each remote object to one Terraform resource address. If you import the same object multiple times, Terraform may exhibit unwanted behavior.

>>> string = "Everything is <replaced> if it's in <tags>."
>>> string = re.sub("<.*>", "ELEPHANTS", string)
>>> string
'Everything is ELEPHANTS.'
re.sub() uses the regular expression "<.*>" to find and replace everything between the first < and the last >, which spans from the beginning of <replaced> to the end of <tags>. This is because Python’s regular expressions are greedy, meaning they try to find the longest possible match when characters like * are used.

A good name for a resource helps you to quickly identify its type, its associated workload, its environment, and the Azure region where it runs. To do so, names should follow a consistent format—a naming convention—that is composed of important information about each resource.

Azure Resource Providers are essentially services within the Azure ecosystem that manage specific types of Azure resources. When you interact with Azure, whether through the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, REST APIs, or SDKs, you're often dealing with these resources. Each resource provider specializes in a particular category of resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, etc.

Requirements for a date table
  It must have a column of data type Date (or date/time), known as the date column.
  The date column must contain unique values.
  The date column must not contain BLANKs.
  The date column must not have any missing dates.
  The date column must span full years. A year isn't necessarily a calendar year (January-December).
  The date table must be indicated as a date table.

Terraform
We refer to the terraform command line tool as "Terraform CLI" elsewhere in the documentation. This terminology is often used to distinguish it from other components you might use in the Terraform product family, such as Terraform Cloud or the various Terraform providers, which are developed and released separately from Terraform CLI.

In Power BI Desktop, you can set the tab order for how a keyboard user will experience your report. First, navigate to the View tab in the ribbon, then select Selection in the Show Panes section.

You'll see Layer order and Tab order, with a list of report elements. Layer order allows you to stack elements, whereas tab order dictates which item will be accessed next when the keyboard user tabs to the next item. Use the up/down arrows to set the order.

Azure AI Search
An index is defined by a schema and saved to the search service, with data import following as a second step. This content exists within your search service, apart from your primary data stores, which is necessary for the millisecond response times expected in modern search applications.

At report design time in Microsoft Power BI Desktop, you can create measures (except when the model is a live connection to SQL Server Analysis Services multidimensional model). These measures belong to the report, and so they're called report-level measures.

HTTP request concept:
OAuth: This is an open standard for authorization that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their credentials. The user is redirected to the authorization server, where they grant access to the third-party application.

Azure Pipelines
Job
A build contains one or more jobs. Most jobs run on an agent. A job represents an execution boundary of a set of steps. All the steps run together on the same agent.

For example, you might build two configurations - x86 and x64. In this case, you have one build and two jobs.

Terraform
While you will typically not want to destroy long-lived objects in a production environment, Terraform is sometimes used to manage ephemeral infrastructure for development purposes, in which case you can use terraform destroy to conveniently clean up all of those temporary objects once you are finished with your work.

The URL used in your copilot represents the scope of content for generating responses. There are requirements and restrictions on some URLs.

If the URL provided redirects to another top-level site, the content isn't included in results:

For example, if www.fabrikam.com redirects to www.contoso.fabrikam.com, your copilot doesn't generate responses from content on either of those URLs.

Azure Log Analytics Workspaces
Each workspace contains multiple tables that are organized into separate columns with multiple rows of data. Each table is defined by a unique set of columns. Rows of data provided by the data source share those columns.

Azure Key Vault
Azure Key Vault enables Microsoft Azure applications and users to store and use several types of secret/key data: keys, secrets, and certificates. Keys, secrets, and certificates are collectively referred to as "objects".





156
Azure Key Vault Secrets
Key Vault also supports a contentType field for secrets. Clients may specify the content type of a secret to help interpreting the secret data when it's retrieved. The maximum length of this field is 255 characters. The suggested usage is as a hint for interpreting the secret data. For instance, an implementation may store both passwords and certificates as secrets, then use this field to differentiate.





157
Terraform
Use the import block to import existing infrastructure resources into Terraform, bringing them under Terraform's management. Unlike the terraform import command, configuration-driven import using import blocks is predictable, works with CICD pipelines, and lets you preview an import operation before modifying state.

General
SED command in UNIX stands for stream editor and it can perform lots of functions on file like searching, find and replace, insertion or deletion. Though most common use of SED command in UNIX is for substitution or for find and replace. By using SED you can edit files even without opening them, which is much quicker way to find and replace something in file, than first opening that file in VI Editor and then changing it.

Paginated reports give a pixel-perfect view of the data. Pixel perfect means that you have total control of how the report renders. If you want a footer on every sales receipt that you create, a paginated report is the appropriate solution.

Use content on SharePoint or OneDrive for Business for generative answers works by pairing your copilot with a URL, such as contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/policies. When a copilot user asks a question and the copilot doesn't have a topic to use for an answer, the copilot searches the URL and all sub-paths. For example, a URL such as contoso.sharepoint.com/sites also includes subpaths like contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/policies.

On the surface, pipx resembles pip because it also lets you install Python packages from PyPI or another package index.
