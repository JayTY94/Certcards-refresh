sklearn
Generalization Error: Generalization error is the measure of a model’s ability to accurately predict outcomes for new, unseen data. Lower generalization error indicates a model that performs well beyond its training data, whereas high error suggests overfitting or poor predictive power.





2
sklearn
LeaveOneOut: This cross-validation technique uses every single observation as its own test set, leaving all other points as the training set. While it provides precise model evaluation, it is computationally expensive, particularly for large datasets.

sklearn
A Hyperparameter search consists of:

    an estimator (regressor or classifier such as sklearn.svm.SVC());
    a parameter space;
    a method for searching or sampling candidates;
    a cross-validation scheme; and
    a score function.

Azure Functions
Just like the other triggers we've seen so far, you can create a blob trigger in the Azure portal. Inside your Azure function, select Blob trigger from the list of predefined trigger types. Then, enter the logic that you want to execute when a blob is created or updated.

One setting that's important to understand is the Path. The Path tells the blob trigger which blob container to monitor to see if a blob is uploaded or updated. By default, the Path value is:

samples-workitems/{name}





8
Azure Functions
Three properties are required in all bindings, though you might have to supply more properties based on the type of binding and storage you're using.

Name - Defines the function parameter through which you access the data. For example, in a queue input binding, this property is the name of the function parameter that receives the queue message content.
Type - Identifies the type of binding. For example, the type of data or service you want to interact with.
Direction - Indicates the direction data is flowing. For example, is it an input or output binding?





9
Azure Functions
In an blob input binding definition:
      "path": "thumbnail-images/{filename}",
Provide the path, which specifies the container and the item name that goes in it. The path property is required when using the blob trigger, and should be provided in the style shown here, with curly braces around the filename portion of the path. This syntax creates a binding expression that allows you to reference the blob's name in other bindings, and in your function's code.





10
Azure Functions
A binding expression is specialized text in function.json, function parameters, or code that is evaluated when the function is invoked, to yield a value. For example, if you have a Service Bus Queue binding, you could use a binding expression to obtain the name of the queue from App Settings.





11
Azure Functions
Every Azure Function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to use multiple triggers, you must create multiple functions.





12
Azure Functions
Trigger types and purpose:
Event Hub: Execute a function when an event hub receives a new event
Event Grid:	Execute a function based on Event Grid subscriptions





13
Dataverse Plugins
The Plugin Execution Pipeline defines the sequence of events where plugins can be triggered in Dataverse. The primary stages include:

Pre-validation: Executes before the main system operation, allowing for early validation.
Pre-operation: Runs after the main operation is validated but before it's committed to the database.
Post-operation: Occurs after the main operation has been completed and committed. Understanding these stages is crucial for placing plugins at the appropriate point in the data processing workflow, ensuring optimal performance and data integrity.





14
Dataverse Plugins
Plugins are custom business logic components that execute in response to specific events within Dataverse, such as record creation or updates. Written in .NET, plugins can enforce business rules, validate data, or integrate with external systems. They are registered against specific messages (like Create, Update) and entities, allowing for granular control over when and how custom logic is triggered within the Dataverse environment.





15
Dataverse Plugins
Filtering Attributes are specific fields defined during the registration of a plugin that determine when the plugin should execute. For instance, a plugin might be set to trigger only when certain attributes of an entity are updated. By specifying these attributes, Dataverse optimizes performance by invoking the plugin only when relevant data changes occur, rather than on every update to the entity.





16
Dataverse Plugins
SDK Message Processing Steps represent the registration details of a plugin within Dataverse. Each step defines when (which message and stage) and how a plugin executes. Key properties include the message (e.g., Update), primary entity, execution pipeline stage (Pre-validation, Pre-operation, Post-operation), and filtering attributes. These steps orchestrate the plugin's behavior in response to data operations.





17
Dataverse Plugins
API Permissions and Scopes define what operations an application can perform and what data it can access within an API like Dataverse Web API. During Azure AD application registration, permissions are granted (e.g., user_impersonation) to control access levels. Scopes specify the exact permissions requested during the authentication process. Proper configuration ensures that applications have the necessary access without over-privileging, adhering to the principle of least privilege for security.





18
Dataverse Plugins
The PluginType entity in Dataverse stores metadata about registered plugins. It includes information such as the plugin's unique identifier (plugintypeid), name, assembly details, and the class implementing the plugin logic. By querying the plugintypes entity via the Web API, developers can retrieve information about specific plugins, facilitating management and debugging of custom business logic.

Python
The load_tests() function in Python’s unittest framework is a hook for customizing test loading and suite creation. It takes three arguments: a test loader, a series of tests, and a test discovery pattern. When you call unittest.main(), load_tests() gets called automatically.





20
Python
import re

def replace_punctuations_and_spaces(input_string):
    # Define the pattern to match all punctuations and spaces
    pattern = r'[^\w]'
    # Replace all matched characters with an empty string
    result = re.sub(pattern, '', input_string)
    return result





21
Python
The CRUD operations correspond almost one-to-one with SQL commands:

Create: INSERT
Read: SELECT
Update: UPDATE
Delete: DELETE
So, to modify existing data in SQL, you would use the UPDATE command.





22
Python
The response headers can give you useful information, such as the content type of the response payload and a time limit on how long to cache the response. To view these headers, access .headers:

>>> import requests

>>> response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
>>> response.headers
{'Server': 'GitHub.com',
...
'X-GitHub-Request-Id': 'AE83:3F40:2151C46:438A840:65C38178'}





23
Python
According to the HTTP specification, POST, PUT, and the less common PATCH requests pass their data through the message body rather than through parameters in the query string. Using Requests, you’ll pass the payload to the corresponding function’s data parameter.

data takes a dictionary, a list of tuples, bytes, or a file-like object.





24
Python
When you make a request, the Requests library prepares the request before actually sending it to the destination server. Request preparation includes things like validating headers and serializing JSON content.

You can view the PreparedRequest object by accessing .request on a Response object:

MS Identity Platform
ID token - ID tokens are sent to the client application as part of an OpenID Connect flow. They can be sent alongside or instead of an access token. ID tokens are used by the client to authenticate the user. To learn more about how the Microsoft identity platform issues ID tokens, see ID tokens in the Microsoft identity platform.





26
MS Identity Platform
The parties in an authentication flow use bearer tokens to assure, verify, and authenticate a principal (user, host, or service) and to grant or deny access to protected resources (authorization). Bearer tokens in the Microsoft identity platform are formatted as JSON Web Tokens (JWT).





27
MS Identity Platform
Authorization server - The Microsoft identity platform is the authorization server. Also called an identity provider or IdP, it securely handles the end-user's information, their access, and the trust relationships between the parties in the auth flow. The authorization server issues the security tokens your apps and APIs use for granting, denying, or revoking access to resources (authorization) after the user has signed in (authenticated).





28
MS Identity Platform
OAuth versus OpenID Connect: The platform uses OAuth for authorization and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0, so the terminology and flow are similar between the two. You can even both authenticate a user (through OpenID Connect) and get authorization to access a protected resource that the user owns (through OAuth 2.0) in one request.





29
MS Identity Platform
If your desktop or mobile application runs on Windows and on a machine connected to a Windows domain (Active Directory or Microsoft Entra joined) it is possible to use the Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) to acquire a token silently. No UI is required when using the application.





30
MS Identity Platform
Resource owner - The resource owner in an auth flow is usually the application user, or end-user in OAuth terminology. The end-user "owns" the protected resource (their data) which your app accesses on their behalf. The resources owners can grant or deny your app (the client) access to the resources they own. For example, your app might call an external system's API to get a user's email address from their profile on that system.

    Pipeline: inpaint





33
Diffusers Library
Forward and Reverse Processes
In diffusion, the forward process gradually adds noise to data, following a fixed probabilistic schedule, and the reverse process learns to denoise the noisy data. Mathematically, the forward process models q(x_t | x_{t-1}), while the reverse learns p(x_{t-1} | x_t) to reconstruct images.





34
Diffusers Library
Variational Inference
A technique for approximating complex probability distributions by simpler ones. In diffusion models, variational inference approximates the posterior distribution of the reverse process, enabling computationally feasible training by simplifying the diffusion and denoising steps.





35
Diffusers Library
Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
These equations describe how noise evolves over continuous time in diffusion models. By defining the noise dynamics, SDEs allow for modeling both forward (adding noise) and reverse (removing noise) processes as smooth, differential transformations.





36
Diffusers Library
Reverse Diffusion
The inverse process where an image is generated by removing noise, step-by-step, from an initial noisy state. This approach is essential in diffusion models, reconstructing data by "reversing" the diffusion process and achieving high-quality image outputs.





37
Diffusers from Hugging Face

40
Diffusers from Hugging Face
Latent Space and Latent Noise: The initial noise, generated with torch.randn, creates latents that represent the starting point in the latent space. This noise is progressively denoised to form the final image.





41
Diffusers from Hugging Face
Scheduler (UniPCMultistepScheduler): A diffusers module that controls the denoising steps of the diffusion process, determining how the image progressively refines with each step toward the prompt.

Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker images are large files that are initially stored on your PC, and we need tools to manage these files.

The Docker CLI and Docker Desktop allow us to manage images by building, listing, removing, and running them. We manage Docker images by using the docker client. The client doesn't execute the commands directly, and sends all queries to the dockerd daemon.





68
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
The bridge network is the default configuration applied to containers when launched without specifying any other network configuration. This network is an internal, private network used by the container, and it isolates the container network from the Docker host network.





69
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker images are stored and made available in registries. A registry is a web service to which Docker can connect to upload and download container images. The most well-known registry is Docker Hub, which is a public registry. Many individuals and organizations publish images to Docker Hub, and you can download and run these images using Docker running on your desktop, on a server, or in the cloud.





70
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
To place a container in the run state, use the run command. You can also restart a container that's already running. When restarting a container, the container receives a termination signal to enable any running processes to shut down gracefully before the container's kernel terminates.





71
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Container storage drives are less performant.

Containers implement a storage driver to allow your apps to write data. This driver introduces an extra abstraction to communicate with the host OS kernel, and is less performant than writing directly to a host filesystem.

Containers can make use of two options to persist data. The first option is to make use of volumes, and the second is bind mounts.





72
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
If you need to terminate the container, use the kill command to send a kill signal. The container's kernel captures the kill signal, but the running process doesn't. This command forcefully terminates the working process in the container.

Lastly, to remove containers that are in a stopped state, use the remove command. After removing a container, all data stored in the container gets destroyed.

Taxes
Purpose: The Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) helps the U.S. government identify persons who may be using foreign financial accounts to circumvent U.S. law and trace funds used for illicit purposes or identify unreported income maintained or generated abroad.





128
Taxes
State-Specific Rules: Different states have different rules and deadlines for Pass-Through Entities (PTEs). For instance, in Hawaii, the Pass-Through Entity (PTE) tax must be paid by the original due date of the return, which for calendar year taxpayers is April 20th following the close of the taxable year.





129
Taxes
The main differences between an S Corp and a C Corp fall into three major categories: formation, taxation, and ownership. Generally, taxes are the biggest and most important difference. C Corps are subject to corporate tax rates, while S Corps allow for pass-through taxation, meaning owners report the business profits and losses on their personal income tax returns.





130
Taxes
Reporting Threshold: The aggregate value of foreign financial accounts must exceed $10,000 at any time during the calendar year to require filing a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR).
Filing Deadline: The Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) is due annually on April 15th, with an automatic extension to October 15th if the deadline is missed.





131
Taxes
Pass-Through Entities (PTEs) include business structures like partnerships and S corporations. The income, deductions, and credits pass through to the individual owners or shareholders, who then report these on their personal tax returns.





132
Taxes
Quarterly Due Dates: Pass-Through Entities (PTEs) often have quarterly estimated tax payment requirements. For example, in California, qualifying Pass-Through Entities (PTEs) may elect to pay an entity-level state tax on income, with payments typically due on or before June 15th and the due date of the original return without regard to extensions.

145
sklearn
When the cv argument is an integer, cross_val_score uses the KFold or StratifiedKFold strategies by default, the latter being used if the estimator derives from ClassifierMixin.

from sklearn import metrics
scores = cross_val_score(
    clf, X, y, cv=5, scoring='f1_macro')
scores
array([0.96..., 1.  ..., 0.96..., 0.96..., 1.        ])





146
sklearn
The cv_results_ attribute contains useful information for analyzing the results of a search. It can be converted to a pandas dataframe with df = pd.DataFrame(est.cv_results_). The cv_results_ attribute of HalvingGridSearchCV and HalvingRandomSearchCV is similar to that of GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, with additional information related to the successive halving process.





147
sklearn
permutation_test_score: This function assesses model performance by computing a baseline distribution of scores via label permutation, creating a null hypothesis benchmark. Comparing the model’s score to this distribution reveals whether its performance is significant or due to random chance.





148
sklearn
The classes in sklearn.neighbors can handle either NumPy arrays or scipy.sparse matrices as input. For dense matrices, a large number of possible distance metrics are supported. For sparse matrices, arbitrary Minkowski metrics are supported for searches.





149
sklearn
When evaluating the resulting model it is important to do it on held-out samples that were not seen during the grid search process: it is recommended to split the data into a development set (to be fed to the GridSearchCV instance) and an evaluation set to compute performance metrics.





150
sklearn
Data leakage occurs when information from the test set inadvertently influences the model during training, leading to overly optimistic performance. Cross-validation methods that respect data structure, like LeavePGroupsOut or TimeSeriesSplit, help prevent this risk.

from sklearn import metrics
scores = cross_val_score(
    clf, X, y, cv=5, scoring='f1_macro')
scores
array([0.96..., 1.  ..., 0.96..., 0.96..., 1.        ])

Azure Functions
Reasons to choose WebJobs over Azure Functions

You have specific customizations that you want to make to the JobHost that aren't supported by Azure Functions.
You want to control your app's retry policies.
WebJobs only supports C# on Microsoft Windows.





152
Azure Functions
API Management	APIM provides security and routing for your HTTP triggered function endpoints as a way to expose them as a true REST API.





153
Azure Functions
By default, functions have a timeout of five (5) minutes. This timeout is configurable to a maximum of 10 minutes. If your function requires more than 10 minutes to execute, you can host it on a VM. Additionally, if your service is initiated through an HTTP request and you expect that value as an HTTP response, the timeout is further restricted to 2.5 minutes.





154
Azure Functions
Monitor: This pattern implements a recurring process in a workflow, possibly looking for a change in state. For example, you could use this pattern to poll until specific conditions are met.





155
Azure Functions
Human interaction: This pattern combines automated processes that also involve some human interaction. A manual process within an automated process is tricky because people aren't as highly available and as responsive as most computers. You can incorporate human interaction using timeouts and compensation logic that runs if the human fails to interact correctly within a specified response time.





156
Azure Functions
Async HTTP APIs: This pattern addresses the problem of coordinating state of long-running operations with external clients. An HTTP call can trigger the long-running action, then redirect the client to a status endpoint. The client can learn when the operation is finished by polling this endpoint.





157
Dataverse Plugins
Error Handling in Dataverse involves interpreting and managing error messages returned by the system during operations. Errors can arise from validation failures, plugin restrictions, permission issues, or data conflicts. Effective error handling requires understanding error codes, messages, and contextual details provided by the system. This enables developers to debug issues, enforce business rules, and provide meaningful feedback to users or calling applications.





158
Python
More coding languages are supported in TensorFlow than in PyTorch, which has a C++ API. You can use TensorFlow in both JavaScript and Swift. If you don’t want to write much low-level code, then Keras abstracts away a lot of the details for common use cases so you can build TensorFlow models without sweating the details.





159
Python
In Python, special methods support comparison operators.

For example, the .__lt__() method supports the < operator, .__gt__() supports >, and the .__eq__() method supports the == operator.

These methods allow you to define custom behavior for comparison operations in your custom classes.





160
Python
Because the decoding of bytes to a str requires an encoding scheme, Requests will try to guess the encoding based on the response’s headers if you don’t specify one. You can provide an explicit encoding by setting .encoding before accessing .text:

>>> response.encoding = "utf-8"  # Optional: Requests infers this.
>>> response.text
'{"current_user_url":"https://api.github.com/user", ...}'





161
Python
You can enhance the input functionality by importing the readline module.

This module provides advanced input capabilities, such as command-line editing and history recall, by overriding the standard input processing and registering handlers for keyboard input.





162
Python
In computer programming jargon, a heisenbug is a software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior when one attempts to study it.[1] The term is a pun on the name of Werner Heisenberg, the physicist who first asserted the observer effect of quantum mechanics, which states that the act of observing a system inevitably alters its state.





163
Python
The print() function allows you to control the format of the output using keyword arguments like sep and end.

The sep argument determines how to separate multiple objects, while the end argument specifies what to print at the end of the output instead of the default newline.

Diffusers Library
Markov Chain
A sequence of random variables where each state depends only on the previous one. In diffusion models, the noise addition process is modeled as a Markov chain, allowing controlled transitions from clear images to noisy ones and vice versa, simplifying the math for training.





167
Diffusers Library
Denoising Process
The step-by-step refinement in diffusion models where the model removes noise from a random input, progressing towards an image. At each step, the model estimates the noise in the image and subtracts it, gradually enhancing coherence and detail.





168
Diffusers Library
Score Matching
A method to train models by estimating the gradient of data probability density (the "score") at each noise level. By approximating this gradient, the model learns to shift noisy data towards regions of higher probability, ultimately leading to denoised, realistic images.





169
Diffusers Library
There are three main components of the library to know about:
Many different schedulers - algorithms that control how noise is added for training, and how to generate denoised images during inference.





170
Diffusers Library
Likelihood Estimation
The process of calculating the probability of the data under the model's parameters. In diffusion models, maximizing this likelihood means finding parameters that make the observed data most probable, allowing for a better approximation of complex data distributions.





171
Diffusers Library
Text-Guided Depth-to-Image Translation: adapt parts of an image guided by a text prompt while preserving structure via depth estimation
    pipeline: depth2img

190
OData
Metadata in OData describes the structure, data types, relationships, and other aspects of the data model. The $metadata endpoint provides the service’s data model and schema definitions using CSDL, essential for understanding available entities and their relationships.





191
OData
A Polymorphic Association is a relationship where an entity can be associated with multiple types of other entities. It requires the use of @odata.type to identify the specific type of related entities, enabling flexible and dynamic associations within the data model.





192
OData
An ETag is a mechanism for concurrency control in OData, representing a version identifier for a resource. It ensures that updates or deletions are performed on the correct version of a record, preventing conflicts and maintaining data integrity.





193
OData
Inheritance Hierarchies allow entities to derive properties and behaviors from parent entities, enabling reuse and polymorphism. Managed in Dataverse using OData's @odata.type, they allow clients to interact with a hierarchy of related entity types effectively.





194
OData
A Delta Token is a marker used in Delta Queries to track changes since the last query. Clients use delta tokens to request only the changes (additions, deletions, updates) that have occurred since their last synchronization, optimizing data retrieval.





195
OData
The @odata.type annotation specifies the exact entity type or derived type being referenced in an OData payload. It is crucial for handling inheritance and polymorphism by informing clients about the specific type of an entity for correct deserialization and processing.

Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
For more advanced scenarios, both Linux and Windows provide additional network options. For example, the overlay option creates a virtual switch from the host network, so containers on that network can get IP addresses from DHCP servers or operate with IP addresses from that network segment. Furthermore, Docker allows third-party vendors to create network plugins.





197
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A registry is organized as a series of repositories. Each repository contains multiple Docker images that share a common name and generally the same purpose and functionality. These images normally have different versions, identified with a tag. This mechanism enables you to publish and retain multiple versions of images for compatibility reasons.





198
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker containers provide security features to run multiple containers simultaneously on the same host without affecting each other. As we learned, we can configure both data storage and network configuration to isolate our containers or share data and connectivity between specific containers.





199
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
The host network enables you to run the container on the host network directly. This configuration effectively removes the isolation between the host and the container at a network level.

Keep in mind that the container can use only ports the host isn't already using.





200
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
1. A container is launched using the --publish 8080:80 flag. Which of the following options is the most likely network configuration used for the container? 
The Bridge network configuration is an internal, private network used by the container and isolates the container network from the Docker host network. We use the publish flag to map ports between the container and host ports.





201
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker provides us with the docker stats command. This command returns information for the container such as percentage CPU usage, percentage memory usage, I/O written to disk, network data sent and received, and process IDs assigned. This information is useful as an immediate data stream; however, no aggregation is done, because the data isn't stored. We'd have to install third-party software for meaningful data capture over a period of time.

Azure Functions
Durable Functions is an extension of Azure Functions that lets you perform long-lasting, stateful operations in Azure. Using this approach, you get all the benefits of a serverless hosting model while letting the Durable Functions framework take care of activity monitoring, synchronization, and runtime concerns.





261
Azure Functions
You can use three durable function types: Client, Orchestrator, and Activity.
Client functions are the entry point for creating an instance of a Durable Functions orchestration. They can run in response to an event from many sources, such as a new HTTP request arriving, a message being posted to a message queue, an event arriving in an event stream. You can write them in any of the supported languages.





262
Azure Functions
Fan out/fan in: This pattern runs multiple functions in parallel and waits for all the functions to finish. You can aggregate the results of the parallel executions or use them to compute a final result.





263
Azure Functions
2. Suppose your Azure Function has a blob trigger associated with it and you want it to execute only when png images are uploaded. Which of the following blob trigger Path values should you use? 

samples-workitems/{name}.png
The Path tells the blob trigger where it should monitor for changes, and if there are any filters applied. Adding a file extension to the Path specifies that uploaded files must have that file extension in order for the trigger to invoke the function.

samples-workitems/{name}.png
The Path tells the blob trigger where it should monitor for changes, and if there are any filters applied. Adding a file extension to the Path specifies that uploaded files must have that file extension in order for the trigger to invoke the function.





264
Azure Functions
Durable Functions allows you to define stateful workflows using an orchestration function. An orchestration function provides these extra benefits:
You can define the workflows in code. You don't need to write a JSON description or use a workflow design tool.
Functions can be called both synchronously and asynchronously. Output from the called functions is saved locally in variables and used in subsequent function calls.





265
Azure Functions
Function chaining: In this pattern, the workflow executes a sequence of functions in a specified order. One function's output is applied to the next function's input in the sequence. The final function's output is used to generate a result.





266
Python
On UNIX-like systems, readline is part of Python’s standard library, so you don’t need to install anything. On modern Windows versions, you don’t even need to work with readline because these advanced editing capabilities are already built into the console natively.





267
Python
If you invoke Response.raise_for_status(), then Requests will raise an HTTPError for status codes between 400 and 600. If the status code indicates a successful request, then the program will proceed without raising that exception.

The .__iter__() special method initializes the iterator and must return an iterator object, typically self.

The .__next__() method retrieves the next value in the data stream and must raise a StopIteration exception when the data stream is exhausted.





268
Diffusers Library
Classifier-Free Guidance

Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A volume is stored on the host filesystem at a specific folder location. Choose a folder where you know the data won't be modified by non-Docker processes.

Docker creates and manages the new volume by running the docker volume create command. This command can form part of our Dockerfile definition, which means that you can create volumes as part of the container-creation process. Docker creates the volume if it doesn't exist when you try to mount the volume into a container the first time.





288
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
Docker containers are the default container architecture the Azure containerization services use, and many other cloud platforms also support them.
