Python
>>> "Hello, {}! Today is {}.".format(name, day)
'Hello, Pythonista! Today is Friday.'

The method interpolates its arguments into the target string using replacement fields limited by curly brackets. Even though this method can produce hard-to-read code, it represents a significant advance over the modulo operator: it supports the string formatting mini-language.

Sessions are used to persist parameters across requests. For example, if you want to use the same authentication across multiple requests, then you can use a session:

import requests

TOKEN = "<YOUR_GITHUB_PA_TOKEN>"

with requests.Session() as session:
    session.auth = TokenAuth(TOKEN)

    first_response = session.get("https://api.github.com/user")
    second_response = session.get("https://api.github.com/user")

Azure Functions
Functions are event driven. They run only in response to an event (called a "trigger"), such as receiving an HTTP request, or a message being added to a queue. You configure a trigger as part of the function definition. This approach simplifies your code by allowing you to declare where the data comes from (trigger/input binding) and where it goes (output binding). You don't need to write code to watch queues, blobs, hubs, and so on. You can focus purely on the business logic.

132
Azure Storage
Transactional databases are often called online transaction processing (OLTP) systems. OLTP systems commonly support many users, have quick response times, and handle large volumes of data. They also are highly available, which means they have minimal downtime. OLTP systems typically handle small transactions or relatively simple transactions.
An example of an Azure service that supports OLTP is Azure SQL Database.




133
Azure Storage
Most Azure resources only work with Resource Manager, which makes it easy to decide which model to choose. However, storage accounts, virtual machines, and virtual networks support both, so you must choose one or the other when you create your storage account. The Resource Manager model adds the concept of a resource group, which isn't available in the classic model.

Python
In pandas, you have several methods at your disposal for data aggregation:

.pivot_table() is great for creating pivot tables that summarize data.
.groupby() is used to group data according to the values in one or more columns.
crosstab() is used to compute a cross-tabulation of two (or more) factors.




139
OData
Action
Actions in OData are operations that can perform modifications on the data, such as updating entities, triggering workflows, or processing business logic. Unlike functions, actions can alter the data or system state and are invoked through POST requests.

Aside from GET, other popular HTTP methods include POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD, PATCH, and OPTIONS. For each of these HTTP methods, Requests provides a function, with a similar signature to get().




143
Python
If you invoke Response.raise_for_status(), then Requests will raise an HTTPError for status codes between 400 and 600. If the status code indicates a successful request, then the program will proceed without raising that exception.




144
Python
.headers returns a dictionary-like object, allowing you to access header values by key. For example, to see the content type of the response payload, you can access "Content-Type":

>>> response.headers["Content-Type"]
'application/json; charset=utf-8'

There’s something special about this dictionary-like headers object, though. The HTTP specification defines headers as case-insensitive, which means that you’re able to access these headers without worrying about their capitalization:




145
Python
import re

def replace_punctuations_and_spaces(input_string):
    # Define the pattern to match all punctuations and spaces
    pattern = r'[^\w]'
    # Replace all matched characters with an empty string
    result = re.sub(pattern, '', input_string)
    return result




146
Python
In Python, special methods support comparison operators.

For example, the .__lt__() method supports the < operator, .__gt__() supports >, and the .__eq__() method supports the == operator.

These methods allow you to define custom behavior for comparison operations in your custom classes.

175
Azure Functions
HTTP triggers let you use API keys to block unknown callers by requiring a key as part of the request. When you create a function, you select the authorization level. By default, it's set to Function, which requires a function-specific API key. It can also be set to Admin to use a global "master" key, or Anonymous to indicate that no key is required. You can also change the authorization level through the function properties after creation.




176
sklearn
The k-means algorithm divides a set of N samples into X an K disjoint clusters C, each described with the mean mu_j of the samples in the cluster. The means are commonly called the cluster "centroids"; note that they are not, in general, points from X, although they live in the same space.

Once we've identified the shape of the trend, we can attempt to model it using a time-step feature. We've already seen how using the time dummy itself will model a linear trend:
target = a * time + b

We can fit many other kinds of trend through transformations of the time dummy. If the trend appears to be quadratic (a parabola), we just need to add the square of the time dummy to the feature set, giving us:
target = a * time ** 2 + b * time + c

Power BI
When a query is evaluated with the Firewall on, the Firewall divides the query and all its dependencies into partitions (that is, groups of steps). Anytime one partition references something in another partition, the Firewall replaces the reference with a call to a special function called Value.Firewall.

Conditional Access
Report-only: User action required	
All configured policy conditions were satisfied but user action would be required to satisfy the required grant controls or session controls. With report-only mode, the user isn't prompted to satisfy the required controls. For example, users aren't prompted for multifactor authentication challenges or terms of use.




198
Power BI
If there are data sources being accessed within the partition, and data flowing in from other partitions, the Firewall loses its ability to be the gatekeeper, since the data flowing in could be leaked to one of the internally accessed data sources without it knowing about it. Thus the Firewall prevents a partition that accesses other partitions from being allowed to directly access any data sources.

Moving Average Plots
To see what kind of trend a time series might have, we can use a moving average plot. To compute a moving average of a time series, we compute the average of the values within a sliding window of some defined width. The idea is to smooth out any short-term fluctuations in the series so that only long-term changes remain.

Python
The re.sub function replaces all occurrences of a specified pattern in a string with a given replacement by default. If you want to replace only the first instance, you can use the count parameter and set it to 1.




223
Python
The .format() method in Python supports different configurations for string interpolation:

Empty replacement fields use the default order of arguments.
Zero-based indices allow you to specify the order of arguments.
Named replacement fields improve readability by matching the arguments’ names in the method call.




224
Python
The response headers can give you useful information, such as the content type of the response payload and a time limit on how long to cache the response. To view these headers, access .headers:

>>> import requests

The connector does not provide an interface for specifying request types or payloads in the UI.




233
Python
Because the decoding of bytes to a str requires an encoding scheme, Requests will try to guess the encoding based on the response’s headers if you don’t specify one. You can provide an explicit encoding by setting .encoding before accessing .text:

>>> response.encoding = "utf-8"  # Optional: Requests infers this.
>>> response.text
'{"current_user_url":"https://api.github.com/user", ...}'

241
Microsoft Copilot Studio
The URL used in your copilot represents the scope of content for generating responses. There are requirements and restrictions on some URLs.

URLs that point to a website, requiring authentication or ones not indexed by Bing.

For example, wikis and SharePoint sites require authentication, therefore can't be used:

fabrikam.visualstudio.com/project/_wiki
fabrikam.sharepoint.com




242
OAuth2.0
The spa redirect type is backward-compatible with the implicit flow. Apps currently using the implicit flow to get tokens can move to the spa redirect URI type without issues and continue using the implicit flow. Despite this backward compatibility, we recommend that you use the auth code flow with PKCE for SPAs.




243
Python
Python sequences have three common characteristics:

  They are iterable, which means you can iterate through them.
  They have a length, which means you can pass them to len() to get the number of elements it contains.
  An element of a sequence can be accessed based on its position in the sequence using an integer index.

Power Platform administration
When you create a user and assign a license in the Microsoft 365 admin center, the user is also created in customer engagement apps. It can take a few minutes to complete the synchronization process between the Microsoft 365 admin center and customer engagement apps.




245
Python
By default, Requests will wait indefinitely on the response, so you should almost always specify a timeout duration to prevent these issues from happening. To set the request’s timeout, use the timeout parameter. timeout can be an integer or float representing the number of seconds to wait on a response before timing out:

requests.get("https://api.github.com", timeout=1)
requests.get("https://api.github.com", timeout=3.05)




246
Microsoft Copilot Studio
Use content on SharePoint or OneDrive for Business for generative answers works by pairing your copilot with a URL, such as contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/policies. When a copilot user asks a question and the copilot doesn't have a topic to use for an answer, the copilot searches the URL and all sub-paths. For example, a URL such as contoso.sharepoint.com/sites also includes subpaths like contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/policies.




247
Python
Authentication helps a service understand who you are. Typically, you provide your credentials to a server by passing data through the Authorization header or a custom header defined by the service. All the functions of Requests that you’ve seen to this point provide a parameter called auth, which allows you to pass your credentials:

>>> import requests

>>> response = requests.get(
...     "https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd",
...     auth=("user", "passwd")
... )




248
Conditional Access
Report-only: Success	
All configured policy conditions, required non-interactive grant controls, and session controls were satisfied. For example, a multifactor authentication requirement is satisfied by an MFA claim already present in the token, or a compliant device policy is satisfied by performing a device check on a compliant device.

A batch request allows clients to send multiple OData operations in a single HTTP request. This reduces the number of HTTP calls and is particularly useful when performing a series of related operations, such as inserting, updating, or deleting multiple entities in one go.




279
OAuth2.0
client_secret	required for confidential web apps	
The application secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. Don't use the application secret in a native app or single page app because a client_secret can't be reliably stored on devices or web pages. It's required for web apps and web APIs, which can store the client_secret securely on the server side. Like all parameters here, the client secret must be URL-encoded before being sent. This step is done by the SDK.

More coding languages are supported in TensorFlow than in PyTorch, which has a C++ API. You can use TensorFlow in both JavaScript and Swift. If you don’t want to write much low-level code, then Keras abstracts away a lot of the details for common use cases so you can build TensorFlow models without sweating the details.

Power Platform administration
To disable a user account, remove a license from the user or remove the user from the security group that's associated with an environment. Removing a user from the security group doesn't remove the user's license. If you want to make the license available to another user, you have to remove the license from the user account that was disabled.

A binding is a declarative way to connect data and services to your function.  Bindings interact with various data sources, which means you don't have to write the code in your function to connect to data sources and manage connections. The platform takes care of that complexity for you as a part of the binding code.

To support offline use, Power Apps allows data to be cached locally on the device. Users can create, update, and delete records while offline, and these changes are synchronized with the Dataverse database once the device reconnects to the internet. This must all be configured ahead of time.

Anytime the data that you’re trying to send or receive is sensitive, security is important. The way that you communicate with secure sites over HTTP is by establishing an encrypted connection using SSL, which means that verifying the target server’s SSL certificate is critical.  

The good news is that Requests does this for you by default. However, there are some cases where you might want to change this behavior. If you want to disable SSL certificate verification, then you pass False to the verify parameter of the request function:

OData
Metadata Document
In OData, the metadata document describes the structure of the OData service, including the entity types, relationships, and properties. It is expressed in an XML format and allows developers and tools to understand the underlying schema of the OData service for integration purposes.

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so replacing the "var" function with "std" is the best approach.

You could calculate the square roots of the existing pivot table data, but this complicates the code.

In Lesson 1, we engineered our time dummy in Pandas directly. From now on, however, we'll use a function from the statsmodels library called DeterministicProcess. Using this function will help us avoid some tricky failure cases that can arise with time series and linear regression. The order argument refers to polynomial order: 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, 3 for cubic, and so on.

Custom Separators and Maximum Depth in json_normalize: The sep parameter in json_normalize lets you define a custom separator for nested keys, defaulting to a dot (.). The max_level parameter allows you to limit how deeply json_normalize flattens nested data, providing control over the normalization process.

Dataverse Queries
Lookup Field
Definition: A special type of field in Dataverse that references a record from another entity (table). It creates a relationship between two entities.
Example: ts_engagementid is a lookup field that points to a record in the ts_engagement entity.




327
Dataverse Queries
_ts_engagementid_value
Definition: A field representing the GUID of a record referenced by a lookup field. In this case, it holds the unique identifier of the related ts_engagement record.



327
Dataverse Queries
_ts_engagementid_value@Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM.lookuplogicalname
Definition: A field that contains the logical name of the entity that the lookup field points to. This helps identify the type of entity related to the GUID in the _ts_engagementid_value field.
Example: The value "ts_engagement" indicates that the lookup points to the ts_engagement entity.



327
Dataverse Queries
Filter Query
Definition: A part of the OData query that allows filtering of data based on specific conditions. In this case, filtering was used to select rows where ts_engagementid equals a certain GUID.
Example: $filter=ts_engagementid/Id eq {engagement_id}

Dataverse Queries
Change Tracking
Definition: A feature that allows the tracking of changes made to data in Dataverse entities. The Web API exposes a mechanism to track when records have been created, updated, or deleted.
Relevance: Useful for scenarios like synchronizing data between systems or auditing changes in your data. The $deltatoken query parameter is used to fetch only the changes since the last request, improving efficiency.




327
Dataverse Queries
$expand
Definition: An OData query option that allows retrieving related data in a single query by expanding related entities.
Relevance: The $expand option is highly useful when you need to retrieve related data (e.g., including a parent entity's information in the same query). It reduces the number of separate API calls required to retrieve related data, optimizing performance.




327
Dataverse Queries
FetchXML
Definition: A proprietary query language used in Dataverse for more advanced querying capabilities. Although the Web API primarily supports OData queries, FetchXML can be used for complex querying scenarios such as joins, aggregates, and advanced filtering.
Relevance: FetchXML is particularly useful for scenarios where OData query limitations are encountered. It can be executed using the Web API through the RetrieveMultiple message.




327
Dataverse Queries
Entity Bound Actions
Definition: These are custom or system-defined actions that are tied to a specific entity and can be invoked via the Web API to perform tasks or trigger workflows.
Relevance: Entity-bound actions are useful for performing more complex business logic or automation that is triggered based on a record in an entity. For example, triggering a workflow on an engagement task when it's completed.




327
Dataverse Queries
Pagination and $top
Definition: Pagination refers to breaking down large sets of data into smaller, more manageable chunks. The $top query parameter controls how many records are returned in a single request.
Relevance: For performance reasons, Dataverse limits the number of records returned in a single API request. Pagination, along with $top, helps in retrieving large datasets incrementally without overwhelming the system.




327
Dataverse Queries
Optimistic Concurrency
Definition: A method of ensuring that data integrity is maintained when multiple users or processes are updating the same record. It checks if the record has been modified since it was last retrieved before allowing updates.
Relevance: This is useful for preventing conflicts in multi-user environments. The Web API uses the If-Match header to implement this mechanism, ensuring that updates happen only if the record has not been altered by another process.




327
Dataverse Queries
Alternate Keys
Definition: In addition to the primary key (usually a GUID), Dataverse allows you to define alternate keys that can be used to uniquely identify records.
Relevance: Alternate keys allow you to perform updates or retrieves based on natural keys (like an email or employee ID), avoiding the need to work directly with GUIDs.
