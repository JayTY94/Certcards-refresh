6
JavaScript Concepts
In JavaScript, you can only return exactly one value. If you want to pass more information, you need to combine it into one entity first, usually into an object, or an array.

function divide(a, b) {
  return {
    quotient: Math.floor(a / b),
    remainder: a % b,
  };
}

JavaScript Concepts
Array slice Function: The slice method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object.
let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let slicedArray = array.slice(1, 4); // Output: [2, 3, 4]





8
JavaScript Concepts
JavaScript's array destructuring syntax is a concise way to extract values from an array and assign them to distinct variables. In this example, each value in the numberOfMoons array is assigned to its corresponding planet:

    const numberOfMoons = [0, 2, 14];
    const [venus, mars, neptune] = numberOfMoons;

    neptune;
    // => 14

JavaScript Concepts
Using Object.entries(): The Object.entries() method returns an array of the object's own enumerable property [key, value] pairs. You can use the for...of loop to iterate over these pairs1.





11
JavaScript Concepts
For arrays, the String function will apply the string conversion for each element and join the results with a comma. You can also apply the join method yourself, e.g. to customize the separator. Note that in these cases null and undefined will be converted to an empty string.

String([42, null, true, 'abc']);
// => '42,,true,abc'





12
JavaScript Concepts
Checks potentially very long playlsit for a specific track by converting to a set and using the Set.has() funciton.
  export function hasTrack(playlist, track) {
    const play_set = new Set (playlist)
    return play_set.has(track)
  }





13
JavaScript Concepts
Dot Notation: You can add a new key-value pair to an object using dot notation. This is useful when you know the name of the property.

const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
obj.key3 = "value3"; // Adds key3 with value3





14
JavaScript Concepts
Logical AND (&&) and OR (||) Statements
if (condition1 && condition2) {
    // Code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are true
}

if (condition1 || condition2) {
    // Code to execute if either condition1 or condition2 is true
}





15
JavaScript Concepts
Front: Can you call functions within a string template?

Back: Yes, you can call functions within ${} in a string template.
  function getName() {
    return 'Jay';
  }
  const greeting = `Hello, ${getName()}!`;
  console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Jay!





16
JavaScript Concepts
Unique Names: All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names, called identifiers. These names can be short (like x and y) or more descriptive (like age, sum, totalVolume). Identifiers can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but they must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign1.





17
JavaScript Concepts
Front: What are tagged templates and how do you use them?

Back: Tagged templates allow you to parse template literals with a function. The function receives the template string and the values as arguments.
  function tag(strings, ...values) {
  console.log(strings); // Array of string segments
  console.log(values);  // Array of values
  return 'Tagged template result';
}
const result = tag`Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(result); // Output: Tagged template result

Component-Based Architecture: Building applications by encapsulating functionality into independent, reusable components, commonly used in frontend frameworks.





19
JavaScript Concepts
If the addition operator + is used for primitive values and one operand is a string, the other one will be coerced into a string as well. The conversion logic is the same as when using the String function. Afterwards, the two strings are concatenated.

let name;
'hello ' + name;
// => 'hello undefined'

FSLogix
Redirector Driver:
A mechanism within FSLogix that intercepts and reroutes file system I/O operations aimed at profile containers. It helps mitigate file locking issues—especially in multi-session environments—by ensuring controlled access to VHD/VHDX files.





122
FSLogix
Profile Container:
A core FSLogix component that encapsulates the entire user profile in a VHD/VHDX file. This approach improves logon/logoff times and reduces issues associated with traditional roaming profiles by loading a single container instead of numerous individual files.





123
FSLogix
Cloud Cache uses the concept of a proxy file, represented as Profile_%username%.vhd though it isn't a true VHD file. The proxy file is used as a means to collect and process all I/O writes destined for the local cache. The I/O writes are buffered in memory and tracked via the proxy file before they're written out as block-level cache objects in the cache directory.





124
FSLogix
Q: What is the role of Profile Disk Differencing in FSLogix?
A: Profile Disk Differencing allows FSLogix to create differencing VHDX disks, where changes to the user profile are stored in separate files, reducing the load on the main profile disk. This improves performance by ensuring faster read/write operations and reducing storage overhead.





125
FSLogix
Q: What is FSLogix App Masking, and how does it relate to managing applications in virtual desktops?
A: FSLogix App Masking is a feature that allows administrators to control which applications are visible to which users in a virtual desktop environment.

126
FSLogix
Antivirus Software Exclusions for FSLogix Container Files:
A best practice in FSLogix deployments. It involves configuring antivirus software to exclude FSLogix container files (both Profile and Office Containers stored in VHD/VHDX format) from scanning. This prevents potential performance degradation and issues during file access.





127
FSLogix
Cloud Cache operates the user's profile from the local cache during the user's session and must be configured with one or more remote storage providers as specified in CCDLocations. These remote storage providers store copies of the local cache and are used during the current session and for subsequent sign ins.





128
FSLogix
Data is written to all storage providers regardless of which provider is used during data hydration.
Performance (latency, utilization, bottlenecks) of a storage provider affects its sync status with the local copy.
Having one (1) or more provider that is behind in updates from local cache could be an indicator of an under performing storage provider.





129
FSLogix
Outlook OST Files:
Offline Storage Table files used by Microsoft Outlook to store a synchronized copy of mailbox data locally. They enable offline access to email, calendar, and contact data. Managing these files in an Office Container prevents them from bloating the main user profile.

Web: ASP.NET, Blazor.
Data: LINQ, Entity Framework.
UI: Windows Forms, WPF.





142
C# Basics
An interface defines a contract that classes must implement. It can contain methods, properties, and events.
Example:
public interface IAnimal {
    void Speak();
}

public class Dog : IAnimal {
    public void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks");
    }
}





143
C# Basics
A constructor is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created.
Example:
public class Car {
    public string Model { get; set; }
    
    public Car(string model) {
        Model = model;
    }
}





144
C# Basics
Events use delegates to provide a way for a class to notify other classes when something happens.
Example:
public delegate void EventHandler();

public class Publisher {
    public event EventHandler Notify;    
    public void RaiseEvent() {
        Notify?.Invoke();
    }
}
public class Subscriber {
    public void OnNotify() {
        Console.WriteLine("Event triggered!");
    }
}





145

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}





148
C# Basics
What are static classes and methods in C#?

C#: A static class cannot be instantiated. Static members belong to the type itself, not an instance.
Example:
public static class MathUtils {
    public static int Add(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }
}

Power BI
Q: What is the typical Power BI Service behavior when you define an Incremental Refresh policy but deploy to a Pro workspace?
A: The service ignores the policy and performs a full‐table refresh each time, without partitioning.





205
Power BI
Q: What indicates a break in query folding when reviewing Query Diagnostics in Power Query?
A: In the “Folding” diagnostic table, any step marked “Not foldable” shows where folding stopped, meaning subsequent transformations happen client‐side.





206
Power BI
Q: What is VertiPaq and why is it relevant when appending tables?
A: VertiPaq is Power BI’s in‐memory columnar engine. When appending tables with identical schemas, VertiPaq compresses and merges columns efficiently, making the in‐memory append step very fast.





207
Power BI
Q: If you freeze only half your rows (e.g., 100 K of 200 K), what kind of refresh time improvement can you expect?
A: Roughly a proportional gain—halving the pulled rows typically cuts variable query time nearly in half; speed-up may be ~40 % overall because fixed overhead (connection setup) remains.





208
Power BI
Q: How can you verify gateway-related issues are not causing silent failures?
A: Download gateway logs (Admin Portal → Gateways → Diagnostics) and search for timeouts or errors (e.g., QueryTimeoutException). Also check gateway CPU/memory spikes.





209
Power BI
Q: What is the default command timeout for the SQL Server connector in Power Query?
A: 10 minutes. Queries taking longer will time out unless you explicitly increase the CommandTimeout in the M step.





210
Power BI
Q: What are the two main components of query execution time when pulling data via SQL?
A: Fixed costs (connection setup, query plan, authentication, network latency) and variable costs (reading/transmitting each row). Reducing row count cuts the variable portion.





211
Power BI
Q: How can using the “Enable Load of Related Entities” option in the Dataverse connector improve performance?
    A:

    This option, in the Dataverse (OData) connector, fetches related lookup or option‐set tables alongside the main entity in one API call.

    Reduces the number of round trips, preserves folding, and can significantly cut down on refresh time compared to separately querying each related table.





212
Power BI
How does ALLEXCEPT work in a measure?
ALLEXCEPT(table, column1, …) removes all filters on the specified table except those on the listed columns. It’s used inside CALCULATE to preserve only certain filters (for example, keep EngagementID but ignore Task Category).





213
Power BI
Q: Why might using a Date dimension table improve model performance and simplify filters?
    A:

    A dedicated Date table lets you create one‐to‐many relationships to fact tables and use date‐intelligence DAX functions efficiently.

    It centralizes filters (e.g., Year, Quarter) rather than filtering on a date column in every fact, reducing the complexity of DAX queries that run during refresh or visual rendering.





214
Power BI
Q: What is “query folding” and why does it matter for refresh timeouts?
A: Query folding means pushing filtering/sorting logic down to the data source. If a step breaks folding, Power Query pulls all rows client-side, increasing data volume and risking timeouts.

SMB Multichannel enables an SMB client to establish multiple network connections to an SMB file share. Azure Files supports SMB Multichannel on SSD file shares for Windows clients. On the service side, SMB Multichannel is now enabled by default for all newly created storage accounts in all Azure regions. There's no extra cost for enabling SMB Multichannel.





240
Azure Files Documentation
The access tier of the file share dictates to the ratio of storage to IOPS/throughput costs (in the form of transactions). There are three access tiers: transaction optimized, hot, and cool. Changing the tier of the Azure file share results in transaction costs for the movement to the new access tier.

Ensure port 445 is open: The SMB protocol requires TCP port 445 to be open. Connections will fail if port 445 is blocked. You can check if your firewall or ISP is blocking port 445 by using the Test-NetConnection PowerShell cmdlet. For more information, see Port 445 is blocked.





245
Azure Files Documentation
To enable AD DS authentication over SMB for Azure file shares, you need to register your Azure storage account with your on-premises AD DS and then set the required domain properties on the storage account. To register your storage account with AD DS, you create a computer account (or service logon account) representing it in your AD DS.

FSLogix
A full VHD(x) clone is performed when Cloud Cache determines, at sign in, that a storage provider isn't at the same sequence. During this operation, all pending writes are kept in the local cache until all storage providers are at the same sequence. Once complete, the flush operation begins sending new data to the storage providers.





365
FSLogix
During a first-time sign-in, FSLogix creates the container for the user in C:\ProgramData\FSLogix\Cache and mounts the container to the virtual machine. Next, FSLogix sets up all the necessary redirections for the user's profile. Then the User Profile Service creates the user's profile into the local cache.

The az login command authenticates your local environment with Azure CLI. Terraform can use these credentials by enabling use_cli = true in your provider block.





431
Terraform Codebox
Terraform provider blocks declare which cloud or service you're configuring. You must include a provider block like azurerm in the root module, even if the actual resources are defined in submodules.


hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
  use_cli = true
}





432
Terraform Codebox
CIFS (Common Internet File System)
A network file-sharing protocol used by Windows and supported on Linux via cifs-utils. It's used in Azure File Shares to mount a remote storage directory into a Linux VM as if it were a local folder.





433
Terraform Codebox
Data sources in Terraform let you read existing cloud resources without managing them. You use them when you want to reference things created outside of Terraform.


hcl
data "azurerm_client_config" "current" {}





434
Terraform Codebox
Shebang (#!/bin/bash)

438
Terraform Codebox
VS Code Remote - SSH extension allows you to edit files and run terminals directly inside a remote VM. Great when you can’t install tools locally.





439
Terraform Codebox
Terraform modules allow you to organize and reuse code. You can define a VM, network, or storage module once and use it in multiple places with different variables passed in.

Example root call:

hcl
module "ephemeral" {
  source = "./modules/ephemeral"
  vm_name = "devbox"
}





440

443
Power BI
Q: Why is a 200 K-row table (40 MB PBIX) unlikely to be “too large” for Power BI Desktop?
A: Power BI regularly handles multi-million-row tables under 100 MB if well-modeled; a 200 K-row table is small. Performance issues usually stem from query complexity or broken folding, not raw size.





444
Power BI
Q: Why might a table visual in Power BI show fewer rows than exist in the dataset even if the data model has all rows?
A: Large table visuals can hit rendering timeouts or be partially truncated. Use Performance Analyzer to see if the DAX query or visual rendering is timing out.





445
Power BI
Q: Why might switching to the Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector improve performance over the SQL connector?
A: The Dataverse connector is designed to leverage server‐side paging and API optimizations, often preserving query folding more reliably and avoiding TDS‐related throttling.





446
Power BI
Q: What tool in Power BI Desktop lets you see which query steps are folding, how long each step takes, and row counts?
A: Query Diagnostics (in Power Query Editor → Tools → Start Diagnostics / Stop Diagnostics).





447
Power BI
Q: How do incremental refresh policies handle late-arriving data, and what can you do to mitigate missed updates?
    A:

    Incremental refresh typically uses a RangeStart/RangeEnd window; any rows older than RangeStart aren’t re-queried.

    To capture late-arriving updates, include a “stale data window” (e.g., overlapping dates) so you reprocess recent partitions that might receive back‐dated changes, then drop duplicates in Power Query or DAX.





448
Power BI
Q: Name one alternative to the SQL connector when connecting to Dataverse that can improve folding and avoid timeouts.
A: Use the built-in Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector via Get Data → Dataverse. It often auto-folds better into Dataverse’s paging model than the SQL (TDS) endpoint.





449
Power BI
Q: Why might “Rows Loaded” in Refresh History show fewer rows than expected even when the status is “Succeeded”?
A: A query may have partially timed out or a partition returned 0 rows (e.g., due to filter/timeout). “Succeeded” can hide warnings about QueryTimeout or skipped partitions.





450
Power BI
When would you use GENERATESERIES in DAX?
GENERATESERIES(start, end, increment) produces a single-column table of numeric values at the specified step size. It’s useful for creating bins or ranges (for example, percentage buckets) for frequency analysis.





451
Power BI
Why can’t you reference a newly added column alias in the same SUMMARIZECOLUMNS call?
DAX processes each expression in a single SUMMARIZECOLUMNS call in isolation, so the engine doesn’t know aliases until after all expressions are parsed. You must either inline the logic or add the column in a separate step.





452
Power BI
What’s the difference between SUMMARIZE and SUMMARIZECOLUMNS?
SUMMARIZE creates a virtual table using a row context that you must convert to filter context with CALCULATE, whereas SUMMARIZECOLUMNS works directly in filter context, handles aggregations and filter modifiers more predictably, and is optimized by the engine for better performance.





453
Power BI
Q: What role does Data Profiling in Power Query play when troubleshooting refresh issues?
A:

    Data Profiling (enable under View → Column quality/Column distribution) lets you see values, error rates, and distinct counts.

    Helps identify unexpected nulls, data type mismatches, or outliers that could increase transformation complexity or break folding.

Use terraform validate: Run this command frequently to catch syntax issues early.
Review Variable References: Confirm that all variable references use the correct var. prefix.





460
Pandas
What is a MultiIndex, and how do you use it?

A MultiIndex allows for hierarchical indexing in rows and columns.

You can create it using set_index() with multiple columns or pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays().

    Example:
df.set_index(['category', 'sub_category'], inplace=True)





461
Pandas
How can you apply multiple aggregation functions after resampling in Pandas?

You can apply functions like sum(), mean(), max(), etc., after resampling.

    Example:
df.resample('M').agg({'value': ['sum', 'mean']})

Azure Files Documentation
To register your storage account with AD DS, you create a computer account (or service logon account) representing it in your AD DS. Think of this process as if it were like creating an account representing an on-premises Windows file server in your AD DS.





473
Azure Files Documentation
If your OU containing the storage account's computer account enforces password expiration, you must update the password before the maximum password age to prevent authentication failures when accessing Azure file shares. See Update the password of your storage account identity in AD for details.





474
Azure Files Documentation
Azure file shares use the Kerberos protocol to authenticate with an identity source. When an identity associated with a user or application running on a client attempts to access data in Azure file shares, the request is sent to the identity source to authenticate the identity.





475

DLP reports a vast amount of information to Microsoft Purview from monitoring policy matches and actions, to user activities. You need to consume and act on that information to tune your policies and triage actions taken on sensitive items. The telemetry goes into the Microsoft 365 audit Logs first, is processed, and makes its way to different reporting tools.





563
Microsoft Purview
In Microsoft Purview, you implement data loss prevention by defining and applying DLP policies. A DLP policy can help you identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive data-at-rest, data-in-motion, and data-in-use. DLP policies act on a variety of locations, methods of data transmission, and types of user activities.





564

Providing Access Through Staff Attributes
Granting access by organizational unit or position allows for less maintenance, but gives less precise control. Including or excluding some staff in various groups may be required. An advantage of granting access through attributes is that new staff or staff whose attributes change are automatically granted access according to their organizational unit or position.

Terraform Codebox
In a Terraform module, names like "main" or "this" are user-defined labels for a resource block. They are not reserved words — you can choose meaningful names to reference resources elsewhere in your config.


hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "this" { ... }
# Reference: azurerm_storage_account.this.name





660
Terraform Codebox
journalctl
A log viewing tool used to inspect logs generated by systemd services. For example, journalctl -xe shows the latest system events — useful for debugging issues like failed mounts or cloud-init errors.





661
Terraform Codebox
Systemd unit files (*.service)
Configuration files that define how a service should start, stop, and behave under systemd. Services like snapd, cloud-init, or ssh rely on these for lifecycle management on modern Linux distros.





662
Terraform Codebox
In Terraform, modules are reusable components that group resources together. You call them from the root module and pass in variables. Modules don't run independently; they're included via the module block in your main configuration.


hcl
module "vm" {
  source = "./modules/ephemeral"
  vm_name = "dev-vm"
}





663
Terraform Codebox
Resource Naming: Use formatdate() or timestamp() to dynamically add creation dates to resources like VMs.


hcl
locals {
  creation_date = formatdate("YYYYMMDD", timestamp())
}





664
Terraform Codebox
ARM Template vs Terraform: Both are infrastructure-as-code for Azure, but Terraform is multi-cloud, more modular, and readable. ARM is native to Azure and more verbose.





665
Terraform Codebox
The .terraform/ directory stores provider binaries and module cache for your Terraform project. It should never be committed to version control, as it may contain large files or local-only paths.





666
Terraform Codebox
The base64encode() function is used in Terraform to convert the rendered cloud-init template into the format expected by the custom_data field of a VM resource.





667
Terraform Codebox
path.module in Terraform refers to the directory containing the module being evaluated. It is used when loading template files (e.g., cloud-init.yaml.tpl) from the same folder.


hcl
templatefile("${path.module}/cloud-init.yaml.tpl", {...})





668
Terraform Codebox
.gitignore is used to tell Git which files or folders not to track. In Terraform projects, this prevents large or sensitive files like .terraform/ and .tfstate from being added accidentally.


markdown
.terraform/
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*





669
Terraform Codebox
Terraform apply -target= allows you to apply or destroy specific modules. Useful when testing or when you want to keep persistent components like storage.


bash
terraform apply -target=module.ephemeral

Terraform Codebox
Cloud-init is a standard way to initialize Linux VMs. Azure reads the custom_data field during VM provisioning and runs your script on first boot.





671
Terraform Codebox
The cloud-init mechanism in Azure allows Terraform to provision the VM on first boot, such as installing software, mounting storage, or configuring files.

Example inside VM block:

hcl
custom_data = base64encode(templatefile("${path.module}/cloud-init.yaml.tpl", {...}))





672
Terraform Codebox
Terraform Registry is where official and community-built modules live. You can browse or install modules like Azure/network/azurerm to save time.

Site: https://registry.terraform.io/





673
Terraform Codebox
SSH keys are used to securely authenticate to a VM. Terraform expects you to pass the public key path and inject it into the VM at creation, enabling key-based access instead of passwords.

Example in variables.tf:

hcl
variable "ssh_public_key_path" {
  default = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
}





674
Terraform Codebox

Power BI
Q: How can you increase the SQL connector’s command timeout in M?
A: In the Sql.Database(...) step, add CommandTimeout=#duration(0,0,20,0) (for 20 minutes), e.g.:

m
Source = Sql.Database("server", "db", [ Query="...", CommandTimeout=#duration(0,0,20,0) ])





676
Power BI
What is the difference between row context and filter context in DAX?
Row context iterates over rows (as in iterators like SUMX or SUMMARIZE), while filter context filters tables for evaluation (as in measures and visuals). CALCULATE is the primary way to convert row context into filter context and apply or modify filters.





677
Power BI
Why might SUMMARIZECOLUMNS yield better performance than SUMMARIZE?
The Tabular engine has built-in optimizations for SUMMARIZECOLUMNS that reduce temporary table materializations and merge identical aggregations, resulting in faster query plans, especially on large fact tables.





678
Power BI
Q: What are the risks of using a static RangeStart parameter over a long period?
A: If you never update RangeStart, new “late-arriving” or back‐dated changes older than that date won’t be captured. You risk permanently missing updates unless you periodically advance the boundary.





679
Power BI
Q: What is the effect of data type mismatches on Power Query folding and performance?
    A:

    If you change a column’s data type (e.g., from text to date) before filtering, Power Query may break folding because the source might not support that conversion natively.

    Always apply type conversions at the end, after filters, or ensure the source can natively convert the type in the same query.





680
Power BI
Q: In a Pro workspace, which Service-side feature that profiles per-table/partition timings is unavailable?
A: The Query Inspector (Query performance pane) in the Power BI Service is only available on Premium or Premium Per User. Pro users only see basic Refresh History.





681
Power BI
Q: How can Aggregations in Power BI speed up queries on large fact tables?
    A:

    Define a summarized (aggregated) table at a higher grain (e.g., daily sales totals) and point visuals to it for common queries.

    The engine stores both the detailed and aggregated tables; for queries that can be satisfied by the aggregate, Power BI never scans the full fact table, reducing query time dramatically.





682
Power BI
Q: What are common pitfalls when manually partitioning with two queries?
A: Forgetting to disable History after its catch-up refresh (causes full pull), mismatched schemas between History & Recent, and letting the Historical table outgrow available memory.





683
Power BI
What pattern lets you reference intermediate calculations by name when building a calculated table?
Use a two-step ADDCOLUMNS approach: first add your intermediate columns, then in a second ADDCOLUMNS call reference those names to compute further results (for example, percentages).





684
Power BI
Q: How do you use Performance Analyzer in Power BI Desktop?
A: In Report view, go to View → Performance Analyzer → Start Recording → Refresh Visuals. It shows DAX query times, visual rendering times, etc., for each visual.





685
Power BI
What’s the scope of variables (VAR) inside an ADDCOLUMNS column definition?
A VAR declared inside one column’s definition lives only within that column. To share results, you must either repeat the logic or separate the columns into multiple ADDCOLUMNS calls so that the column values exist in the table.





686
Azure DevOps Pipelines
What is the default trigger for a YAML-based pipeline in Azure DevOps?
Answer: A trigger based on code changes in a Git repository.





687
Azure DevOps Pipelines
How can you trigger a pipeline based on a Git tag in Azure DevOps?
Answer: You use the trigger keyword with the tags sub-keyword to specify that the pipeline should trigger when a Git tag is pushed.

Example:
trigger:
  tags:
    include:
      - v*





688

690
Terraform
Expressions and Operators:
Definition: Terraform uses expressions to compute values. These support arithmetic operations, string concatenation, and comparisons.
Usage: Allows dynamic configuration based on variable values or conditions.

Example:


"${var.a + var.b}"
"${var.env == "prod" ? "Production" : "Staging"}"





691
Terraform
Local Values:
Definition: Local values allow you to define computed variables within a configuration to simplify expressions or avoid repetition.
Usage: Useful for intermediate calculations or to centralize common values.

Example:

locals {
  app_name = "myapp"
  instance_count = length(var.instance_ids)
}





692
Pandas
How can you fill missing values using interpolation in a time-series column?

Use .interpolate() to perform interpolation on missing values.

    Example:
df['value'] = df['value'].interpolate(method='linear')





693
Pandas
What does the unstack() function do in Pandas?

unstack() "unpivots" a DataFrame by converting the index into columns.

    Example:
df.groupby(['category', 'sub_category']).sum().unstack()





694

KEEPFILTERS is a modifier, not a standalone function.
You can only use KEEPFILTERS inside a filter argument of CALCULATE or CALCULATETABLE; it can’t wrap an entire table expression on its own.





696
Python + Oauth2.0
("localhost", 8080)

The address tuple passed to `TCPServer`. It tells the server to listen on port 8080 of the local machine. This must match the `redirect_uri` registered with the OAuth provider.
with socketserver.TCPServer(("localhost", 8080), OAuthHandler) as httpd:
    ...





697
Python + Oauth2.0
OAuthHandler (Custom HTTP Request Handler)

A subclass of `http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` that overrides the `do_GET` method to process incoming HTTP requests. It extracts the authorization code from the URL and initiates the token exchange process.





698
Python + Oauth2.0
base64.b64encode

Encodes the client ID and secret into a base64 string for use in the `Authorization` header. This is required by the OAuth token endpoint to authenticate the client during the token exchange.





699
Python + Oauth2.0
redirect_uri

The URL where the OAuth provider sends the user after login. It must match the one registered with the provider. In this script, it's `http://localhost:8080/callback`, which points to a local server waiting to catch the redirect.





700
Python + Oauth2.0
do_GET()

A method in `SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` that is automatically called when the server receives a GET request. You override this method to define custom behavior, such as parsing the URL and responding with HTML or triggering logic like token exchange.





701
Python + Oauth2.0
authorize_url

The endpoint where the user is sent to log in and grant access. It’s part of the OAuth provider’s infrastructure and handles user authentication and consent.





702
Python + Oauth2.0
with socketserver.TCPServer(...) as httpd

A context manager that ensures the server is properly started and shut down. It simplifies cleanup and avoids leaving open sockets after the request is handled.

On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

AD DS is commonly adopted by enterprises in on-premises environments or on cloud-hosted VMs, and AD DS credentials are used for access control. For more information, see Active Directory Domain Services Overview.





707
Azure Files Documentation
You can enable identity-based authentication over SMB using one of three identity sources: On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Microsoft Entra Domain Services, or Microsoft Entra Kerberos (hybrid identities only). You can only use one identity source for file access authentication per storage account.





708
Azure Files Documentation
If a client successfully authenticates to an identity source, that identity source returns a Kerberos ticket. Azure Files authenticates requests with that Kerberos ticket, not user credentials.





709
Azure Files Documentation
By default access is limited to the Active Directory forest where the storage account is registered. Users from any domain in that forest can access the file share contents, provided they have the appropriate permissions.





710
Azure Files Documentation
SMB Multichannel enables clients to use multiple network connections that provide increased performance while lowering the cost of ownership. Increased performance is achieved through bandwidth aggregation over multiple NICs and utilizing Receive Side Scaling (RSS) support for NICs to distribute the I/O load across multiple CPUs.
