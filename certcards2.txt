Cloud Cache uses the concept of a proxy file, represented as Profile_%username%.vhd though it isn't a true VHD file. The proxy file is used as a means to collect and process all I/O writes destined for the local cache. The I/O writes are buffered in memory and tracked via the proxy file before they're written out as block-level cache objects in the cache directory.





9
FSLogix
Q: How does FSLogix improve Office 365 performance in Azure Virtual Desktop?

11
FSLogix
On a lazy asynchronous operation, Cloud Cache flushes the changes to all storage providers simultaneously as each provider is flushed on its own thread. FSLogix doesn't throttle this operation and utilizes as much throughput as the system will allow.





12
FSLogix
Cloud Cache operates the user's profile from the local cache during the user's session and must be configured with one or more remote storage providers as specified in CCDLocations. These remote storage providers store copies of the local cache and are used during the current session and for subsequent sign ins.





13
FSLogix
Q: What is FSLogix App Masking, and how does it relate to managing applications in virtual desktops?
A: FSLogix App Masking is a feature that allows administrators to control which applications are visible to which users in a virtual desktop environment.

14
FSLogix
All data written to the user's profile is temporarily stored as block-level cache objects in the same directory. Those block-level cache objects are then committed to the local cache. Before the block-level cache objects are created, the writes into the user's profile are processed in memory through a proxy file.

123
Azure Functions + Visual Studio
ASP.NET Core provides built-in Dependency Injection (DI) support, enabling you to manage dependencies in your application. This makes your code more modular, testable, and easier to maintain.





124
Azure Functions + Visual Studio
ASP.NET offers several state management techniques, including Session State, View State, and Cookies, to retain data across user requests and provide a better user experience on dynamic websites.





125
Azure Functions + Visual Studio
ASP.NET supports asynchronous programming with async and await keywords, allowing non-blocking operations such as file and database access. This improves scalability and performance by freeing up threads during long-running tasks.





126
Azure Functions + Visual Studio

129
Terraform
Remote Backends and Interpolation:
Definition: Terraform can store state remotely (e.g., in AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage). Variable interpolation may be used to configure these backends dynamically.
Example:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = var.state_bucket
    key    = "path/to/my/key"
    region = var.region
  }
}





130
Terraform
Expressions and Operators:
Definition: Terraform uses expressions to compute values. These support arithmetic operations, string concatenation, and comparisons.
Usage: Allows dynamic configuration based on variable values or conditions.

Example:


"${var.a + var.b}"
"${var.env == "prod" ? "Production" : "Staging"}"





131
Terraform
For Expressions:

Definition: These are used to transform or filter collections (lists or maps) inline.
Usage: Useful for generating new lists or maps based on existing ones without using external loops.
Example:

[for instance in var.instances : instance.id]





132
Terraform
Configuration Blocks:
These are the building blocks of Terraform code, such as resource, module, provider, and output blocks.





133
Terraform
Dynamic Blocks:
Definition: Allow you to construct nested blocks dynamically based on complex data structures.
Usage: Ideal for when the number of nested blocks is not fixed and depends on variable data.

Example:

dynamic "ingress" {
  for_each = var.ingress_rules
  content {
    from_port = ingress.value.from
    to_port   = ingress.value.to
    protocol  = ingress.value.protocol
  }
}





134
Terraform
Splat Operator:
Definition: The splat operator (*) extracts attributes from every element in a list of resources.
Usage: Handy for working with multiple resource instances in a compact way.
Example:

"${aws_instance.web.*.id}"

Extension methods allow you to add functionality to existing types without modifying their source code.
Example:
public static class StringExtensions {
    public static bool IsNullOrEmpty(this string str) {
        return string.IsNullOrEmpty(str);
    }
}





238
C# Basics
Tuples allow grouping multiple values into a single object without defining a class.
Example:
var person = (Name: "John", Age: 30);
Console.WriteLine(person.Name);  // Output: John





239
C# Basics
How do basic data types work in C#?

    private string[] grades = new string[3];

    public string this[int index] {
        get { return grades[index]; }
        set { grades[index] = value; }
    }
}





244
C# Basics
Generics allow you to define classes, methods, or data structures with type parameters, enabling type safety and reusability.
Example:
public class Box<T> {
    public T Value { get; set; }
}

var intBox = new Box<int> { Value = 10 };

FSLogix
During a first-time sign-in, FSLogix creates the container for the user in C:\ProgramData\FSLogix\Cache and mounts the container to the virtual machine. Next, FSLogix sets up all the necessary redirections for the user's profile. Then the User Profile Service creates the user's profile into the local cache.





251
FSLogix
Cloud Cache uses the locally mounted container to provide periodic updates to the remote storage providers. Cloud Cache is designed to insulate users from short-term or intermittent local (inner-region, close proximity) storage issues.





252
FSLogix
Data is written to all storage providers regardless of which provider is used during data hydration.
Performance (latency, utilization, bottlenecks) of a storage provider affects its sync status with the local copy.
Having one (1) or more provider that is behind in updates from local cache could be an indicator of an under performing storage provider.





253
FSLogix
During a user's session when the connection to any storage provider becomes unhealthy, FSLogix queues up all the changes and then flushes them to the providers when they return to a healthy state.





254
FSLogix
Using Cloud Cache puts a performance and storage requirement on the virtual machine to accommodate the extra I/O operations and storage required by the local cache.





255
FSLogix
When the local cache doesn't contain the data requested by the file system, Cloud Cache hydrates (reads and copies) the data from 1 of the remote storage providers to the local cache. This operation is also part of the sign in process when populating the local cache for the user's profile.





256
FSLogix
A full VHD(x) clone is performed when Cloud Cache determines, at sign in, that a storage provider isn't at the same sequence. During this operation, all pending writes are kept in the local cache until all storage providers are at the same sequence. Once complete, the flush operation begins sending new data to the storage providers.





257
FSLogix
Q: What is the role of Profile Disk Differencing in FSLogix?
A: Profile Disk Differencing allows FSLogix to create differencing VHDX disks, where changes to the user profile are stored in separate files, reducing the load on the main profile disk. This improves performance by ensuring faster read/write operations and reducing storage overhead.

Logging in Python
Q: What should you do to ensure that logging.basicConfig() has an effect in Python's logging module?

A: Call it before adding any custom handlers or performing other logging configurations, and ensure that the root logger doesn't already have handlers attached.
This ensures that basicConfig properly initializes the logging system without being overridden.





259
Logging in Python
Q: What is a NullHandler used for in Python's logging module?

A: To discard log messages, preventing "No handler" warnings in library code.
This is useful for libraries to ensure they don't interfere with the application's logging configuration.





260
Logging in Python
Q: Why is it important to centralize logging configuration in large applications using Python's logging module?

A: Centralizing logging configuration ensures consistency, makes it easier to manage, and prevents scattered and conflicting logging setups across different modules.
This approach streamlines logging management and enhances maintainability.





261
Logging in Python
Q: What is the role of a Formatter in a logging handler within Python's logging module?

262
Logging in Python
Q: What is one of the main disadvantages of using Python's built-in logging module?

A: It can be overly complex and verbose for simple applications or scripts.
The extensive features may introduce unnecessary complexity when basic logging needs are sufficient.





263
Logging in Python
Q: If a child logger has propagate set to False, what does this mean?

A: It will not pass log messages to the parent logger.
This isolates the logger, ensuring that messages are handled only by its own handlers.





264
Logging in Python
Q: What is the impact of setting a logger's level higher than its handler's level in Python's logging module?

A: Log messages must meet or exceed the logger's level to be processed by the handler, regardless of the handler's own level.
This means that even if a handler is set to a lower level, it won't handle messages below the logger's threshold.

C#: A delegate is a type that holds references to methods, while an event is a special type of delegate that can only be invoked by the class that declares it, enforcing encapsulation.
Example:
public delegate void MyEvent();
public event MyEvent EventTriggered;

C# Basics
A constructor is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created.
Example:
public class Car {
    public string Model { get; set; }
    
    public Car(string model) {
        Model = model;
    }
}
