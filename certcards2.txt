FSLogix
During a first-time sign-in, FSLogix creates the container for the user in C:\ProgramData\FSLogix\Cache and mounts the container to the virtual machine. Next, FSLogix sets up all the necessary redirections for the user's profile. Then the User Profile Service creates the user's profile into the local cache.





69
FSLogix
Cloud Cache uses the locally mounted container to provide periodic updates to the remote storage providers. Cloud Cache is designed to insulate users from short-term or intermittent local (inner-region, close proximity) storage issues.





70
FSLogix
Data is written to all storage providers regardless of which provider is used during data hydration.
Performance (latency, utilization, bottlenecks) of a storage provider affects its sync status with the local copy.
Having one (1) or more provider that is behind in updates from local cache could be an indicator of an under performing storage provider.





71
FSLogix
During a user's session when the connection to any storage provider becomes unhealthy, FSLogix queues up all the changes and then flushes them to the providers when they return to a healthy state.





72
FSLogix
On a lazy asynchronous operation, Cloud Cache flushes the changes to all storage providers simultaneously as each provider is flushed on its own thread. FSLogix doesn't throttle this operation and utilizes as much throughput as the system will allow.





73
FSLogix
Cloud Cache operates the user's profile from the local cache during the user's session and must be configured with one or more remote storage providers as specified in CCDLocations. These remote storage providers store copies of the local cache and are used during the current session and for subsequent sign ins.





74
FSLogix
A full VHD(x) clone is performed when Cloud Cache determines, at sign in, that a storage provider isn't at the same sequence. During this operation, all pending writes are kept in the local cache until all storage providers are at the same sequence. Once complete, the flush operation begins sending new data to the storage providers.





75
FSLogix
All data written to the user's profile is temporarily stored as block-level cache objects in the same directory. Those block-level cache objects are then committed to the local cache. Before the block-level cache objects are created, the writes into the user's profile are processed in memory through a proxy file.

139
Logging in Python
Q: What is the impact of setting a logger's level higher than its handler's level in Python's logging module?

A: Log messages must meet or exceed the logger's level to be processed by the handler, regardless of the handler's own level.
This means that even if a handler is set to a lower level, it won't handle messages below the logger's threshold.





140
Logging in Python
Q: How can you prevent log messages from bubbling up to parent loggers in Python's logging module?

A: By setting propagate=False on the child logger.
This stops the log messages from being handled by ancestor loggers, ensuring they are processed only by the child logger's handlers.

Double Quotes vs. Single Quotes:

Double Quotes (" "): Allow variable interpolation.
Single Quotes (' '): Do not interpolate variables; they treat the content as a literal string.





520
Terraform
Variable References:
Refer to variables using the var. prefix within interpolation expressions. For example:

${var.env}





521
Terraform
Expressions and Operators:
Definition: Terraform uses expressions to compute values. These support arithmetic operations, string concatenation, and comparisons.
Usage: Allows dynamic configuration based on variable values or conditions.

Example:


"${var.a + var.b}"
"${var.env == "prod" ? "Production" : "Staging"}"





522
Terraform
Variable Declaration:
Use the variable block to declare variables. For example:

variable "env" {
  description = "The deployment environment"
  type        = string
}





523

Dynamic Blocks:
Definition: Allow you to construct nested blocks dynamically based on complex data structures.
Usage: Ideal for when the number of nested blocks is not fixed and depends on variable data.

Example:

dynamic "ingress" {
  for_each = var.ingress_rules
  content {
    from_port = ingress.value.from
    to_port   = ingress.value.to
    protocol  = ingress.value.protocol
  }
}





525

h
Copy
"${join(",", var.instance_ids)}"
split(delimiter, string): Splits a string into a list.
lookup(map, key, default): Retrieves a value from a map.





526
Terraform
Debugging Tips:
Check Quotes: Ensure that you use double quotes for strings that require interpolation.
Use terraform validate: Run this command frequently to catch syntax issues early.
Review Variable References: Confirm that all variable references use the correct var. prefix.

This provides a unified experience regardless of which VM the user accesses.





533
FSLogix
Q: What happens to a FSLogix Profile Container when a user logs off?
A: When a user logs off, the changes made to the profile are saved back into the Profile Container (VHDX file), ensuring that all settings and data are retained for the next session.
