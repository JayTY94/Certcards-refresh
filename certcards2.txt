David is the Security Administrator at his organization. He is investigating an issue where the corporate server will not accept any connections using the TCP protocol. On close inspection he sees that the server indicates that it has exceeded its session limit. Which type of attack is this?

Remote browser isolation (RBI) is a web security technology that neutralizes online threats by hosting users’ web browsing sessions on a remote server instead of the user’s endpoint device. RBI separates web content from the user’s device to reduce its attack surface.

IDS is primarily focused on evaluating attacks based on attack signatures and audit trails. An A-signature-based IDS will monitor packets on the network and compare them against a database of signatures or attributes from known malicious threats. This is similar to the way most antivirus software detects malware.

Software Diversity
	Alternative compiler paths would result in a different binary each time
		Each compiled application would be a little different, but functionality would be the same.
	An attack against different binaries would only be successful on a fraction of users
		An attacker wouldn't know what exploit to use

Another type of UPS is a line-interactive UPS. If the voltage is slowly diminishing on the line, the UPS can slowly ramp up the amount of power being provided by the batteries. So during brownouts or times when the voltage is not at optimal levels, the line-interactive UPS can fill in the differences for the power source.

TCP session hijacking is a technique that involves intercepting a TCP session initiated between two machines in order to hijack it. The initial authentication is performed by the legitimate machine. Later, the hacker who wishes to launch this attack takes control of the connection throughout the duration of the session.

One of the simplest and least expensive of the UPS is an offline or standby UPS. This is a UPS that is not normally enabled unless power is lost. If the UPS recognizes that the power source is gone, it will switch over to battery power. So there’s a short time frame between the time when power is lost and then power is made available from the UPS.

Confusion
Confusion means that each binary digit (bit) of the ciphertext should depend on several parts of the key, obscuring the connections between the two.[2]
The property of confusion hides the relationship between the ciphertext and the key.
Confusion increases the ambiguity of ciphertext and it is used by both block and stream ciphers.

SYN attacks exploit the TCP three-way handshake and overload the servers, resulting in authorized users being denied access to network resources. The attacker uses a spoofed IP address not in use on the Internet and sends multiple SYN packets to the target machine.

The kind of UPS that’s probably the most complex and the most expensive is the online, or what is called the double conversion, UPS. This UPS is always online and always providing power to your devices. And if the power does go out, there’s no switching process, because you’re already on battery power.

In an XML document or external entity, a CDATA section is a piece of element content that is marked up to be interpreted literally, as textual data, not as marked up content.[1] A CDATA section is merely an alternative syntax for expressing character data; there is no semantic difference between character data in a CDATA section and character data in standard syntax where, for example, "<" and "&" are represented by "&lt;" and "&amp;", respectively.

A power distribution unit (PDU) is a device fitted with multiple outputs designed to distribute electric power, especially to racks of computers and networking equipment located within a data center.[1] Data centers face challenges in power protection and management solutions. This is why many data centers rely on PDU monitoring to improve efficiency, uptime, and growth
