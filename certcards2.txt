I had a ticket with Lauren Kawamoto going back to 11/22/24 about her permissions in the sandbox. It turns out that she needed the "TS - Recur Engagement" role to recur engagements. I thought that "system administrator" would be enough, but I was not able to do that myself with the sysadmin role. Strange.

A search service runs one indexer job per search unit. If you need concurrent processing, make sure you have sufficient replicas. Indexers don't run in the background, so you might detect more query throttling than usual if the service is under pressure.





106
Azure AI Search
After the first indexer run, you can rerun it on demand or set up a schedule.

You can monitor indexer status in the Azure portal or through Get Indexer Status API. You should also run queries on the index to verify the result is what you expected.





107

169
Taxes
An S Corporation is a type of corporation that meets specific Internal Revenue Code requirements. The main difference between an S Corp and a C Corp is how they are taxed. An S Corp is a pass-through entity, meaning that the corporation's income, deductions, and credits pass through to the shareholders, who report these on their personal tax returns.





170
PP365

Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
The host network enables you to run the container on the host network directly. This configuration effectively removes the isolation between the host and the container at a network level.

Keep in mind that the container can use only ports the host isn't already using.





321
Azure Kubernetes Learning Path
A volume is stored on the host filesystem at a specific folder location. Choose a folder where you know the data won't be modified by non-Docker processes.

Docker creates and manages the new volume by running the docker volume create command. This command can form part of our Dockerfile definition, which means that you can create volumes as part of the container-creation process. Docker creates the volume if it doesn't exist when you try to mount the volume into a container the first time.
