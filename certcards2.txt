Filtering Router
An inter-network router that selectively prevents the passage of data packets according to a security policy. A filtering router may be used as a firewall or part of a firewall. A router usually receives a packet from a network and decides where to forward it on a second network. A filtering router does the same, but first decides whether the packet should be forwarded at all, according to some security policy. The policy is implemented by rules (packet filters) loaded into the router.

Use guest access and external access to collaborate with people outside your organization:

Guest access - A feature that allows you to invite people from outside your organization to join a team. Guests can also call, chat, and meet with people in your organization and you can share files and folders with them. Invited people get an Azure AD B2B collaboration guest account in your directory.

MS Teams
Guests are added to your organization's Azure Active Directory as B2B collaboration users. They must sign in to Teams using their guest account. If the normally use Teams with another Microsoft 365 organization, they need to switch organizations in Teams to interact with your organization.




6
MS Teams
When you invite a guest to Teams, a guest account is created for them in Azure Active Directory and they are covered by the same compliance and auditing protection as other Microsoft 365 users. Guest access is subject to Azure AD and Microsoft 365 service limits.

If you just want to find, call, chat, and set up meetings with people in other Microsoft 365 organizations, use external access.

As an admin, you can add a new guest to the organization in a couple of ways:
    Global administrators or Teams administrators and team owners can add a guest to a team in the Teams clients or in the Teams admin center.

MS Teams
Guests can leave the team at any time from within Teams. For details, see the article "How do I leave a team?". Leaving the team doesn't remove the guest account from our organization's directory. This must be done using a Microsoft 365 global admin or an Azure AD admin.




13

You can track guest additions in Azure AD or the Microsoft 365 security center. Adding a guest in Teams is audited and logged as an Azure AD group administration activity "Added member to group".

You can perform a guest access review yourself, ask guests to review their own access, or ask an application owner or business decision maker to perform the access review. Reviews are done in Azure AD. For more information, see the article "Manage guest access with Azure AD access reviews".
