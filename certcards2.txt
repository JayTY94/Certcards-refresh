EAP-TTLS (Extensible Authentication Protocol - Tunneled Transport
Layer Security) allows the use of multiple authentication protocols
transported inside of an encrypted TLS (Transport Layer Security) tunnel.
This allows the use of any authentication while maintaining confidentiality
with TLS.

A. EAP-TLS
EAP-TLS does not provide a mechanism for using multiple
authentication types within a TLS tunnel.
B. PEAP
PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) encapsulates EAP
within a TLS tunnel, but does not provide a method of encapsulating
other authentication methods.
