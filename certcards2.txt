A security team has been provided with a non-credentialed vulnerability
scan report created by a third-party. Which of the following would they
expect to see on this report?
The Answer: C. The version of web server software in use
A scanner like Nmap can query services and determine version numbers
without any special rights or permissions, which makes it well suited for
non-credentialed scans.

A CASB (Cloud Access Security Broker) can be used to apply security
policies to cloud-based implementations. Two common functions of a
CASB are visibility into application use and data security policy use. Other
common CASB functions are the verification of compliance with formal
standards and the monitoring and identification of threats.

A security administrator is designing an authentication process for a
new remote site deployment. They would like the users to provide their
credentials when they authenticate in the morning, and they do not want
any additional authentication requests to appear during the rest of the
day. Which of the following should be used to meet this requirement?
The Answer: C. Kerberos
Kerberos uses a ticket-based system to provide SSO (Single Sign-On)
functionality. You only need to authenticate once with Kerberos to gain
access to multiple resources.

A security engineer runs a monthly vulnerability scan. The scan doesn’t
list any vulnerabilities for Windows servers, but a significant vulnerability
was announced last week and none of the servers are patched yet. Which
of the following best describes this result?
INCORRECT:C. Zero-day attack
A zero-day attack focuses on previously unknown vulnerabilities. In this
example, the vulnerability scan isn’t an attack, and the vulnerabilities are
already known and patches are available

A company is deploying a new mobile application to all of its employees
in the field. Some of the problems associated with this rollout include:
• The company does not have a way to manage the mobile devices
in the field
• Company data on mobile devices in the field introduces additional risk
• Team members have many different kinds of mobile devices
Which of the following deployment models would address
these concerns?
C. VDI
A VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) would allow the field teams to
access their applications from many different types of devices without the
requirement of a mobile device management or concern about corporate
data on the devices.

A security team has been provided with a non-credentialed vulnerability
scan report created by a third-party. Which of the following would they
expect to see on this report?
INCORRECT: A summary of all files with invalid group assignments
Viewing file permissions and rights requires authentication to the
operating system, so you would not expect to see this information if the

C. Validate the processes and procedures for all
outgoing employees
The disabling of an employee account is commonly part of the offboarding
process. One way to validate an offboarding policy is to perform an audit
of all accounts and compare active accounts with active employees.

and an important financial transfer was delayed until they returned.
Which of the following would have prevented this delay?

A security analyst has identified a number of sessions from a single IP
address with a TTL equal to zero. One of the sessions has a destination of
the Internet firewall, and a session immediately after has a destination of
your DMZ server. Which of the following BEST describes this
log information?
he Answer: D. Someone is performing a traceroute to the DMZ server
A traceroute maps each hop by slowly incrementing the TTL (Time
to Live) value during each request. When the TTL reaches zero, the
receiving router drops the packet and sends an ICMP (Internet Control
Message Protocol) TTL Exceeded message back to the original station.
