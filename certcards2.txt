In Python f-strings, the flags !s and !r allow you to control how objects are converted into strings. The !s flag uses the object’s .__str__() method, which is intended to return a user-friendly string representation. The !r flag uses the object’s .__repr__() method, which should return a developer-friendly string representation that could be used to re-create the object.

In a Python Template string, placeholders consist of two parts: a dollar sign ($) followed by a valid Python identifier. This is different from other string interpolation methods that might use curly braces or percentage symbols. Valid identifiers are those that can be used as variable names in Python, which include letters, underscores, and digits but can’t start with a digit or be a Python keyword.

more_numbers = [1, 2, 2, 10, 20]
When you compare these lists, you’ll find that numbers is greater than more_numbers.

Power BI
Power Query provides two easy ways to create parameters:

From an existing query: Right-click a query whose value is a simple non-structured constant, such as a date, text, or number, and then select Convert to Parameter.
Using the Manage Parameters window: Select the New Parameter option from the dropdown menu of Manage Parameters in the Home tab. Or launch the Manage Parameters window and select New on the top to create a parameter. Fill in this form, and then select OK to create a new parameter.





209
Power BI
A warning with query diagnostics, as mentioned elsewhere, is that you'll see drastically different capabilities depending on the connector. For example, many ODBC based connectors won't have an accurate recording of what query is send to the actual backend system, as Power Query only sees what it sends to the ODBC driver.

211
Python
The modulo operator (%) is the oldest tool for performing string interpolation in Python. Even though you can use this operator for both eager and lazy string interpolation, the syntax could be more readable and clean.

You need to insert conversion specifiers into your strings and then use the modulo operator to interpolate the desired values:

>>> x = 5
>>> y = 10
>>> "The sum of %d and %d is %d." % (x, y, x + y)
'The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.'





212
Power BI
When you display the usage metrics report, Power BI generates a pre-built report. It contains usage metrics for that content for the last 30 days. The report looks similar to the Power BI reports you're already familiar with. You can slice based on how your end users received access, whether they accessed via the web or mobile app, and so on.

Power Platform administration
To disable a user account, remove a license from the user or remove the user from the security group that's associated with an environment. Removing a user from the security group doesn't remove the user's license. If you want to make the license available to another user, you have to remove the license from the user account that was disabled.

Workera.ai
Persisted parameter values are stored in the working directory of the Azure storage account used by Azure Cloud Shell. If you are using a local install of the Azure CLI, values are stored in the working directory on your machine.





216
Python
In eager string interpolation, Python inserts the values into the string at execution time in the same place where you define the string. In lazy string interpolation, Python delays the insertion until the string is actually needed. In this latter case, you create string templates at one point in your code and fill the template with values at another point.

Python
Adding an equal sign after a variable or expression in an f-string creates a self-documenting expression. This feature is particularly useful for debugging because it not only shows the result of the expression but also the expression itself, making what is being evaluated clear. For example, print(f"{value = }") would output value = Suspicious value, showing both the variable name and its value.

Power BI
If there are data sources being accessed within the partition, and data flowing in from other partitions, the Firewall loses its ability to be the gatekeeper, since the data flowing in could be leaked to one of the internally accessed data sources without it knowing about it. Thus the Firewall prevents a partition that accesses other partitions from being allowed to directly access any data sources.

In order for your single-partition-but-two-data-sources query to be allowed to run, its two data sources must be "compatible". In other words, it needs to be okay for data to be shared bidirectionally between them. This means that the privacy levels of both sources need to be Public, or both be Organizational, since these are the only two combinations that allow sharing in both directions.

You can also use dictionaries and named replacement fields:

>>> jane = {"name": "Jane", "job": "Python Dev"}

>>> "My name is %(name)s. I'm a %(job)s." % jane
"My name is Jane. I'm a Python Dev."

In this example, the modulo operator inserts each value using the corresponding key, which is way more readable and intuitive. To build the named replacement fields, you need to insert the name in parentheses between the % sign and the format specifier.

Microsoft Copilot Studio
Use content on SharePoint or OneDrive for Business for generative answers works by pairing your copilot with a URL, such as contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/policies. When a copilot user asks a question and the copilot doesn't have a topic to use for an answer, the copilot searches the URL and all sub-paths. For example, a URL such as contoso.sharepoint.com/sites also includes subpaths like contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/policies.





264
Azure Pipelines
Job
A build contains one or more jobs. Most jobs run on an agent. A job represents an execution boundary of a set of steps. All the steps run together on the same agent.

For example, you might build two configurations - x86 and x64. In this case, you have one build and two jobs.





265
Azure Key Vault Secrets
Key Vault also supports a contentType field for secrets. Clients may specify the content type of a secret to help interpreting the secret data when it's retrieved. The maximum length of this field is 255 characters. The suggested usage is as a hint for interpreting the secret data. For instance, an implementation may store both passwords and certificates as secrets, then use this field to differentiate.

Power Platform administration
In DAX, when you use SUMX or similar functions that iterate over a table, the context within which the function operates changes to the row context of that table. This means each row of the table becomes the current context for the calculation during each iteration of the function. Because of this row context, you don’t need to explicitly reference the table name when accessing its columns within the function.
