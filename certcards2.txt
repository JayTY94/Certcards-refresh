Source data tables are mature and ready for immediate use. If you have a table as such, bring it into your data model and don't use any other methods that are outlined in this section. We recommend that you use a source date table because it is likely shared with other tools that you might be using in addition to Power BI.

Normalization vs. denormalization: Normalization is the term used to describe data that’s stored in a way that reduces repetitious data. In contrast, denormalization refers to storing product details beyond the key in a sales table. Star schemas are typically denormalized to improve performance and ensure accurate results.

The Model view in Power BI desktop provides many options within the column properties that you can view or update. A simple method to get to this menu to update the tables and fields is by Ctrl+clicking or Shift+clicking items on this page.
Under the Advanced tab, you can:

  Sort by a specific column.
  Assign a specific category to the data.
  Summarize the data.
  Determine if the column or table contains null values.

Under the General tab, you can:

  Edit the name and description of the column.
  Add synonyms that can be used to identify the column when you are using the Q&A feature.
  Add a column into a folder to further organize the table structure.
  Hide or show the column.

To create a date table in Power Query:

  New Query > Blank Query
  = List.Dates(#date(2011,05,31), 365*10, #duration(1,0,0,0))
    Makes a list of dates starting May 31, 2011, 1 day increment, ~10 years
  Transform > Convert > To Table
  Convert datatype of column to Date
  Create additional columns for hierarchy

You can use the PATH() function to return a string which contains a delimited list of IDs, starting with the top/root of a hierarchy and ending with the specified ID. For example, in an Employees table that contains employees, their managers, and their managers’ managers, you can return the path that connects an employee to his or her manager.

In an Analytic Query, Summarizing produces a single value result. Typically, numeric columns are summarized by using summarization methods (sum, count, and many others). More complex summarizations, like a percent of grand total, can be achieved by defining measures that are written in DAX.

In an Analytic Query, filtering, or slicing, targets the data of relevance. In Power BI reports, filters can be applied to three different scopes: the entire report, a specific page, or a specific visual. Filtering is also applied in the background when row-level security (RLS) is enforced.

A Power BI hierarchy is a collection of related fields within a dataset, arranged in a way that displays one element ranked over the other fields. It is a useful structure for drill-down and data exploration in reports.

Power Virtual Agents
In Power Virtual Agents unified authoring release, you can now send an entire Object, whether that be a Dataverse record or a collection of Dataverse records, to send back using the text output of the Power Virtual Agents return statement.

The PATH() function is used to convert a parent-child relationship in a delimited text format. The syntax of the PATH() function is 

  PATH(<ID_columnName>, <parent_columnName>).

Creating a hierarchy in Power BI is straightforward. You can right-click on the field you want to set as level 1 of the hierarchy in the fields list and select "Create Hierarchy". You can then add additional levels to the hierarchy by dragging and dropping or using the “Add to hierarchy” option





13
MS Data Analyst
A hierarchy consists of multiple levels, where one level is the parent of another level. For example, a category, subcategory, and product can form a hierarchy. There is no limit on the number of levels; it can be one or more than ten levels.

Power BI imposes dataset size restrictions, which limit the size of a model. When you publish the model to a shared capacity, there’s a 1-GB limit per dataset. When this size limit is exceeded, the dataset will fail to refresh.

Choose the import model framework whenever possible. This framework offers you the most options, design flexibility, and delivers fast performance. Be sure to apply data reduction techniques to ensure that Power BI loads the least amount of data possible.

Under the Formatting tab, you can:

  Change the data type.
  Format the date.

In the syntax of Power Query statements, the # character is not used as a special character or escape sequence. It is primarily used in M to represent special characters such as tabs, carriage returns, and line feeds.

plays an important role in filtering data between multiple tables. When you load data, Power BI automatically looks for relationships that exist within the data by matching column names. You can also use Manage Relationships to edit these options manually.

Many-to-many (.) relationship:

  Describes a relationship where many values are in common between two tables.
  Does not require unique values in either table in a relationship.
  Is not recommended; a lack of unique values introduces ambiguity and your users might not know which column of values is referring to what.




3
MS Data Analyst
An example of a many-to-many relationship could be between the Sales and Order tables of a model on the OrderDate column because multiple sales can have multiple orders associated with them. Ambiguity is introduces because both tables can have the same order date.

A word of caution regarding bi-directional cross-filtering: You should not enable bi-directional cross-filtering relationships unless you fully understand the ramifications of doing so. Enabling it can lead to ambiguity, over-sampling, unexpected results, and potential performance degradation.Pa

To change the properties of data columns, go to the Model tab and select the columns you want to change. This will reveal the Properties pane, where you can do things like change the default summarization, hide the column, or set the number of decimal places to display.

Data granularity indicates the level the detail within the data, so the higher the granularity, the more detail that is represented in the data.

Cardinality is the measure of unique values in a table. An example of high cardinality would be a Sales table as it has a high number of unique values.

You can use hierarchies to create drill-down reports, where users can navigate through the levels of the hierarchy to view more detailed information. They can also be used to create calculations and measures that aggregate data at different levels of the hierarchy

MS Data Analyst
To create a hierarchy in Power BI Desktop, go to the data view on your Power BI Desktop and select the top-level element. Right-click on that element and select ‘New hierarchy’. That will now create a new hierarchy with only the top-level element in it. To put the other elements on the hierarchy, simply drag them to the hierarchy

MS Data Analyst
Hierarchies are a way to organize data in a way where one element is ranked over the other. They allow you to drill up or down on your visual and reveal additional details.




11
MS Data Analyst
There are specific considerations and limitations for hierarchies in Power BI Desktop:

  Up to 10,000 items per hierarchy (across all datasets)
  Up to five hierarchies
  Up to five levels per hierarchy
