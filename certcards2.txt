Setup and management: With single tenancy, MSSPs need to deploy a single instance for every new customer. Configurations and analytics are not easily shared among end customers, decreasing scalability.

When you reference a table in a formula, officially, the table name is enclosed within single quotation marks. In the following calculated table definition, notice that the Date table is enclosed with single quotation marks.


```
Ship Date = 'Date'

You can write a DAX formula to add a calculated column to any table in your model. The formula is evaluated for each table row and it returns a single value. When added to a DirectQuery storage mode table, the formula is evaluated by the underlying source database when the table is queried.

Managed security service providers (MSSPs) handle multiple customers within their technology stack. Therefore they need technology that makes them more efficient. Multitenancy is a critical capability that helps MSSPs improve efficiency.

Azure Monitor is a service in Azure that provides performance and availability monitoring for applications and services in Azure, other cloud environments, or on-premises. Azure Monitor collects data from multiple sources into a common data platform where it can be analyzed for trends and anomalies.

An example that uses the IN logical operator is the ANZ Revenue measure definition, which uses the CALCULATE DAX function to enforce a specific filter of two countries: Australia and New Zealand.

  ANZ Revenue =

      Customer[Country-Region] IN {
          "Australia",

Software multitenancy is an architecture where a single instance of the software serves multiple tenants or groups of users. The multitenant architecture provides every tenant with a dedicated share of the instance, including configuration and data. For MSSPs, the tenants are typically separate customers

It's possible to precede a measure reference with its table name. However, measures are a model-level object. While they're assigned to a home table, it's only a cosmetic relationship to logically organize measures in the Fields pane.

Therefore, while we recommend that you always precede a column reference with its table name, the inverse is true for measures: We recommend that you never precede a measure reference with its table name.

Public cloud architectures are multi-tenant environments—users share a pool of virtual resources that are automatically provisioned for and allocated to individual tenants through a self-service interface. This means that multiple tenants’ workloads might be running CPU instances running on shared physical server at the same time.

Use the ampersand (&) character to connect, or concatenate, two text values to produce one continuous text value. For example, consider the following calculated column definition:

  Model Color = 'Product'[Model] & "-" & 'Product'[Color]

In DAX, single quotation marks around a table name can be omitted when both of the following conditions are true:

  The table name does not include embedded spaces.
  The table name isn't a reserved word that's used by DAX. All DAX function names and operators are reserved words.

When you reference a column in a formula, the column name must be enclosed within square brackets. Optionally, it can be preceded by its table name. For example, the following measure definition refers to the Sales Amount column.

An excellent formatting tool from another source that can help you format your calculations is DAX Formatter. This tool allows you to paste in your calculation and format it. You can then copy the formatted calculation to the clipboard and paste it back into Power BI Desktop.

All Azure subscriptions have a trust relationship with a Microsoft Entra tenant. Subscriptions rely on this tenant (directory) to authenticate and authorize security principals and devices. When a subscription expires, the trusted instance remains, but the security principals lose access to Azure resources.

You can create a service connection from Azure Pipelines to external and remote services for executing tasks in a job. Once you establish a connection, you can view, edit, and add security to the service connection. You can also manage different types of service connections with the az devops service-endpoint command3.

The design of your service connections should meet your organization’s requirements. Some companies prefer to create service connections per subscription to control the exposure of any given service principal to a specific subscription. Having a proper design saves time and solves the problem of too many service connections.

Because column names are unique within a table but not necessarily unique within the model, you can disambiguate the column reference by preceding it with its table name. This disambiguated column is known as a fully qualified column. Some DAX functions require passing in fully qualified columns.

A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund that is typically established by countries with large amounts of surplus income from natural resources, trade, or other sources. The purpose of a sovereign wealth fund is to invest the surplus income to generate long-term financial returns that can be used for various purposes such as supporting future generations, stabilizing the economy, or funding social welfare programs.

In September 2018, Microsoft combined Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Application Insights into a single service to provide powerful end-to-end monitoring of your applications and the components they rely on. Features in Log Analytics and Application Insights haven't changed, although some features have been rebranded to Azure Monitor to better reflect their new scope.

The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them. They may be free or sold on-demand, allowing customers to pay only per usage for the CPU cycles, storage, or bandwidth they consume.

Whitespace is optional and it doesn't modify your formula logic or negatively impact performance. We strongly recommend that you adopt a format style and apply it consistently, and consider the following recommendations:

  Use spaces between operators.
  Use tabs to indent nested function calls.
  Use carriage returns to separate function arguments, especially when it's too long to fit on a single line. Formatting in this way makes it simpler to troubleshoot, especially when the formula is missing a parenthesis.
  Err on the side of too much whitespace than too little.

Power BI Desktop supports a feature called What-if parameters. When you create a what-if parameter, a calculated table is automatically added to your model.

What-if parameters allow report users to select or filter by values that are stored in the calculated table. Measure formulas can use selected value(s) in a meaningful way.

We recommend that you use the DIVIDE function whenever the denominator is an expression that could return zero or BLANK. In this case, the division is guaranteed to succeed and pass an alternative value, and your expression will perform better because it will avoid unnecessary testing.
