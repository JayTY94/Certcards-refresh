Descriptive analytics help answer questions about what has happened based on historical data. Descriptive analytics techniques summarize large datasets to describe outcomes to stakeholders.

By developing key performance indicators (KPIs), these strategies can help track the success or failure of key objectives.

A data warehouse is a centralized repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources. Data warehouses store current and historical data in relational tables that are organized into a schema that optimizes performance for analytical queries.

Data Transformation: Operational data usually needs to be transformed into suitable structure and format for analysis, often as part of an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process; though increasingly a variation in which you extract, load, and transform (ELT) the data is used to quickly ingest the data into a data lake and then apply "big data" processing techniques to transform it

Five key areas that you'll engage in during the data analysis process.

	1. Prepare
	2. Model
	3. Visualize
	4. Analyze
	5. Manage

Apache Spark is a parallel processing framework that takes advantage of in-memory processing and a distributed file storage. It's a common open-source software (OSS) tool for big data scenarios.

Eidetic memory, also known as photographic memory and total recall, is the ability to recall an image from memory with high precision—at least for a brief period of time—after seeing it only once and without using a mnemonic device1. The term eidetic comes from the Greek word εἶδος (eidos) meaning "visible form"1.

Data Integration involves establishing links between operational and analytical services and data sources to enable secure, reliable access to data across multiple systems

Apps can be a valuable distribution method for your content and allow easier management for large audiences. This feature also allows you to have custom navigation experiences and link to other assets within your organization to complement your reports.

Prescriptive analytics techniques rely on machine learning as one of the strategies to find patterns in large datasets. By analyzing past decisions and events, organizations can estimate the likelihood of different outcomes.

Power BI
AppSource is a marketplace for cloud-based business applications. In the context of Power BI template apps, AppSource is a platform where you can find, download, and deploy pre-built Power BI solutions.

Power BI template apps are pre-built solutions designed to help you quickly and easily deploy industry-specific solutions, such as financial reporting, sales analysis, and inventory management. These apps are created by Microsoft or by their partners and are available for download from AppSource.

Generally, diagnostic analytics occurs in three steps:

	Identify anomalies in the data. These anomalies might be unexpected changes in a metric or a particular market.

	Collect data that's related to these anomalies.

	Use statistical techniques to discover relationships and trends that explain these anomalies.

Proper management can also help reduce data silos within your organization. Data duplication can make managing and introducing data latency difficult when resources are overused. Power BI helps reduce data silos with the use of shared datasets, and it allows you to reuse data that you have prepared and modeled

Data consolidation is the process of combining data that has been extracted from multiple data sources into a consistent structure - usually to support analytics and reporting.

The idea with a data lake is to store everything in its original, untransformed state. This approach differs from a traditional data warehouse, which transforms and processes the data at the time of ingestion.

Diagnostic analytics help answer questions about why events happened. Diagnostic analytics techniques supplement basic descriptive analytics, and they use the findings from descriptive analytics to discover the cause of these events. Then, performance indicators are further investigated to discover why these events improved or became worse.

Azure Pipelines
A pipeline is made up of stages. A pipeline author can control whether a stage should run by defining conditions on the stage. Another way to control if and when a stage should run is through approvals and checks.




2
Azure Pipelines
Pipelines rely on resources such as environments, service connections, agent pools, variable groups, and secure files. Checks enable the resource owner to control if and when a stage in any pipeline can consume a resource. As an owner of a resource, you can define checks that must be satisfied before a stage consuming that resource can start. 




3
Azure Pipelines
An example of a Pipeline check is a manual approval check on an environment, which would ensure that deployment to that environment only happens after the designated user(s) has reviewed the changes being deployed.






4
Azure Pipelines
A stage can consist of many jobs, and each job can consume several resources. Before the execution of a stage can begin, all checks on all the resources used in that stage must be satisfied. Azure Pipelines pauses the execution of a pipeline prior to each stage, and waits for all pending checks to be completed. 




5
Azure Pipelines
Approvals and other checks aren't defined in the yaml file. Users modifying the pipeline yaml file can't modify the checks performed before start of a stage. Administrators of resources manage checks using the web interface of Azure Pipelines.

Upside
In private equity, funds and investors seek out underperforming or undervalued companies that they can take private and turn around, before going public years later. Buyout firms are involved in management buyouts (MBOs), in which the management of the company being purchased takes a stake. They often play key roles in leveraged buyouts, which are buyouts that are funded with borrowed money.
