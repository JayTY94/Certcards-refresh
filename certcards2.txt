In Unattended Task Mining, All data is encrypted before being sent to the service and remains encrypted until a model job-specific container is created for processing and then the results are again encrypted before being written to disk. It is likely the same with Assisted Task Mining.

Fragment Offset
The fragment offset field tells the sender where a particular fragment falls in relation to other fragments in the original larger packet.

Security+
Store-and-Forward
Store-and-Forward is a method of switching where the entire packet is read by a switch to determine if it is intact before forwarding it.

Security+
regression analysis
The use of scripted tests which are used to test software for all possible input is should expect. Typically developers will create a set of regression tests that are executed before a new version of a software is released. Also see "fuzzing".

Reflexive ACLs (Cisco)
Reflexive ACLs for Cisco routers are a step towards making the router act like a stateful firewall. The router will make filtering decisions based on whether connections are a part of established traffic or not.

An IT department doesn’t commonly operate in a vacuum. There are usually customers of IT that have applications, data, and other technical resources that the IT department is managing for them. These are the stakeholders in your organization, and when something is not working properly, it’s the stakeholders that are going to be suffering.

Daemon
A program which is often started at the time the system boots and runs continuously without intervention from any of the users on the system. The daemon program forwards the requests to other programs (or processes) as appropriate. The term daemon is a Unix term, though many other operating systems provide support for daemons, though they're sometimes called other names. Windows, for example, refers to daemons and System Agents and services.

Security+
Internet Standard
A specification, approved by the IESG and published as an RFC, that is stable and well-understood, is technically competent, has multiple, independent, and interoperable implementations with substantial operational experience, enjoys significant public support, and is recognizably useful in some or all parts of the Internet.

Horizontal Privilege Escalation
Horizontal privilege escalation means that a user will achieve access permissions belonging to another user that owns the same access level as the user that has started the cyberattack. It is a bit more challenging compared to vertical ones since they require a deep understanding of how operating systems work.
