The theory of the Diamond Model
This methodology underlines the relationships and characteristics of four components of the diamond—adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim. These four core elements are connected to delineate the relationship between each other which can be analytically examined to further uncover insights and gain knowledge of malicious activities.

Broadcasts have a limited scope. They can only traverse the networks that are connected in a single broadcast domain. When we talk about using a VLAN on our network, that VLAN is a broadcast domain. And any broadcast sent to that VLAN will only be sent to other devices that are on that same VLAN.

If an API has not been properly developed or tested, an attacker may be able to find a vulnerability that wouldn’t be able to use the functionality of the application, but it might be able to cause the application to fail.

When a disaster or security incident occurs, we need to find some other way to get our job done. And often, this will require continuity of operations planning (COOP).

One challenge we have with our layer 2 networks is there’s no mechanism built into layer 2 communication that is able to recognize and remove loops from the network.

A common on-path attack on a local IP subnet is an ARP poisoning. This is an Address Resolution Protocol poisoning. And that’s because ARP, as a protocol, does not have any type of security associated with it. Devices receive and modify ARP tables without any type of authentication or any type of encryption. This would allow an attacker to send ARPs to any device on the local subnet, and those local devices would interpret the ARPs as if they were coming from a legitimate source.

Code Signing is similar to the process we use to provide encryption certificates on web servers. We first need a trusted certificate authority who’s going to sign the developer’s public key. The developer will then use their private key to digitally sign any code that they happen to be deploying. That means that you can validate that this code is exactly what was deployed by the original developer, by validating it with their public key.

It’s important that the application developer understand exactly what input is being used, and how that input is being handled by the application.

When setting a Deadline or a Postpone date for an Orchestrator transaction, we recommend populating the respective fields with relative dates. For example, DateTime.Now.AddHours(2), DateTime.Now.AddDays(10) and DateTime.Now.Add(New System.TimeSpan(5, 0, 0, 0)). Additionally, you can use the US notation to add an exact time, such as 10/10/2019 07:40:00. Automatic correction of this date is available, for example, if you write 12 10 2019 9:0, it is automatically transformed to 12/10/2019 09:00:00.

Once the power goes out, there’s usually a 10- or 15-second waiting period to see if the power happens to turn back on. And if it does not, the generator turns on and begins providing power to the building. During that 10 or 15 seconds, though, you will need some type of internal power in the building to make sure that all of your systems remain up and running, which is why you might combine both the UPS and the generator power.
