Another way to use tooltips is to display graphical information. The process of adding this type of tooltip is not as straightforward, but it is worthwhile. You would begin by creating a new page in the report.

Open the new page and then open the Format pane. Expand the Page Size section and then select Tooltip from the Type list.

In the Page information section, turn the Tooltip slider to On so that Power BI registers this page as a tooltip page

Tooltips have limited canvas space, so to ensure that your visuals appear in the tooltip, on the View tab, set the Page view option to Actual size.

As enterprises grow, so does their data. Often, strict requirements and regulations must be applied to ensure that this sensitive data is secure. Power BI provides a few different ways to help you accomplish this task:

Use Microsoft sensitivity labels to label dashboards, reports, semantic models, and dataflows by using the same taxonomy that is used to classify and protect files in Microsoft 365.
Add more protection measures such as encryption and watermarks when you are exporting the data.
Use Microsoft Cloud App Security to monitor and investigate activities in Power BI.

When a requirement is in place to lay out many slicers, consider creating a page that is dedicated to showing all slicers. For example, the page could be named Slicers. Sync the slicers to other pages and then set the slicers as hidden on those pages. This design technique will require that report consumers should always go to the Slicers page to modify slicer settings.

Terraform
Terraform must store state about your managed infrastructure and configuration. This state is used by Terraform to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures.






20
Terraform
This state is stored by default in a local file named "terraform.tfstate", but we recommend storing it in Terraform Cloud to version, encrypt, and securely share it with your team.




1
Terraform
The primary purpose of Terraform state is to store bindings between objects in a remote system and resource instances declared in your configuration. When Terraform creates a remote object in response to a change of configuration, it will record the identity of that remote object against a particular resource instance, and then potentially update or delete that object in response to future configuration changes.




2
Terraform
While the format of the state files are just JSON, direct file editing of the state is discouraged. Terraform provides the terraform state command to perform basic modifications of the state using the CLI.




3
Terraform
For some providers like AWS, Terraform could theoretically use something like AWS tags. Early prototypes of Terraform actually had no state files and used this method. However, we quickly ran into problems. The first major issue was a simple one: not all resources support tags, and not all cloud providers support tags.




4
Terraform
In addition to basic mapping, Terraform stores a cache of the attribute values for all resources in the state. This is the most optional feature of Terraform state and is done only as a performance improvement.






5
Terraform
In the default configuration, Terraform stores the state in a file in the current working directory where Terraform was run. This is okay for getting started, but when using Terraform in a team it is important for everyone to be working with the same state so that operations will be applied to the same remote objects. Remote state is the recommended solution to this problem.






6
Terraform
Terraform expects that each remote object is bound to a single resource address. You should import each remote object to one Terraform resource address. If you import the same object multiple times, Terraform may exhibit unwanted behavior.




7
Terraform
The terraform import CLI command can only import resources into the state. Importing via the CLI does not generate configuration. If you want to generate the accompanying configuration for imported resources, use the import block instead.






8
Terraform
Use the import block to import existing infrastructure resources into Terraform, bringing them under Terraform's management. Unlike the terraform import command, configuration-driven import using import blocks is predictable, works with CICD pipelines, and lets you preview an import operation before modifying state.

Terraform
The command line interface to Terraform is the terraform command, which accepts a variety of subcommands such as terraform init or terraform plan.






11
Terraform
We refer to the terraform command line tool as "Terraform CLI" elsewhere in the documentation. This terminology is often used to distinguish it from other components you might use in the Terraform product family, such as Terraform Cloud or the various Terraform providers, which are developed and released separately from Terraform CLI.




12
Terraform
Main commands:
  init          Prepare your working directory for other commands
  validate      Check whether the configuration is valid
  plan          Show changes required by the current configuration
  apply         Create or update infrastructure
  destroy       Destroy previously-created infrastructure
  




13
Terraform
The Terraform CLI commands interact with the HashiCorp service Checkpoint to check for the availability of new versions and for critical security bulletins about the current version.






14
Terraform
Terraform expects to be invoked from a working directory that contains configuration files written in the Terraform language. Terraform uses configuration content from this directory, and also uses the directory to store settings, cached plugins and modules, and sometimes state data.






15
Terraform
Run the terraform init command to initialize a working directory that contains a Terraform configuration. After initialization, you will be able to perform other commands, like terraform plan and terraform apply.






16
General
Idempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.




17
Terraform
Most Terraform providers are published separately from Terraform as plugins. During init, Terraform searches the configuration for both direct and indirect references to providers and attempts to install the plugins for those providers.






18
Terraform
During init, the configuration is searched for module blocks, and the source code for referenced modules is retrieved from the locations given in their source arguments.






19
Terraform
The terraform plan command evaluates a Terraform configuration to determine the desired state of all the resources it declares, then compares that desired state to the real infrastructure objects being managed with the current working directory and workspace. 



20
Terraform
Terraform plan uses state data to determine which real objects correspond to which declared resources, and checks the current state of each resource using the relevant infrastructure provider's API.







1
Terraform
The terraform apply command performs a plan just like terraform plan does, but then actually carries out the planned changes to each resource using the relevant infrastructure provider's API.




2
Terraform
By default, terraform apply performs a fresh plan right before applying changes, and displays the plan to the user when asking for confirmation. However, it can also accept a plan file produced by terraform plan in lieu of running a new plan.




3
Terraform
The terraform destroy command destroys all of the resources being managed by the current working directory and workspace, using state data to determine which real world objects correspond to managed resources. Like terraform apply, it asks for confirmation before proceeding.




4
Terraform
A destroy behaves exactly like deleting every resource from the configuration and then running an apply, except that it doesn't require editing the configuration. This is more convenient if you intend to provision similar resources at a later date.

By default, when Terraform creates a plan it:

	• Reads the current state of any already-existing remote objects to make sure that the Terraform state is up-to-date.
	• Compares the current configuration to the prior state by noting any differences.
Proposes a set of change actions that should, if applied, make the remote objects match the configuration.

Planning Options: Alongside the special planning modes, there are also some options you can set in order to customize the planning process for unusual needs.
Resource Targeting is one particular special planning option that has some important caveats associated with it.

Terraform
Refresh-only mode: creates a plan whose goal is only to update the Terraform state and any root module output values to match changes made to remote objects outside of Terraform. This can be useful if you've intentionally changed one or more remote objects outside of the usual workflow (e.g. while responding to an incident) and you now need to reconcile Terraform's records with those changes.

When using Terraform on Windows, we recommend using the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe). When you pass a variable value to Terraform from the Windows Command Prompt, use double quotes " around the argument:

terraform plan -var "name=value"

Terraform
When you pass a saved plan file to terraform apply, Terraform takes the actions in the saved plan without prompting you for confirmation. Use terraform show to inspect a saved plan file before applying it.
