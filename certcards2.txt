Python
Q:
How does using yield from affect the performance of a generator?

A:
yield from can improve performance by delegating part of the generator’s operations to another generator, reducing overhead and simplifying code.

Example:
def generator1():
    yield from range(1000)

def generator2():
    yield from generator1()

Q:
How can generators be used to implement a producer-consumer pattern?

A:
Generators can act as producers by yielding data, which consumers can iterate over, allowing for efficient and decoupled data processing.

Example:
def producer():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i

Q:
How can you memoize a generator function to cache its results?

A:
By using decorators like functools.lru_cache() on generator functions, although it's generally more suited for regular functions. For generators, you might need to implement custom caching.

Note:
functools.lru_cache() does not work directly with generator functions since they return iterators. Instead, consider converting the generator to a list and then caching.

How DKIM helps SPF: DKIM can validate messages that fail SPF. For example:

    Messages from an email hosting service where the same MAIL FROM address is used for mail from other domains.
    Messages that encounter server-based email forwarding.
    Because the DKIM signature in the message header isn't affected or altered in these scenarios, these messages are able to pass DKIM.
