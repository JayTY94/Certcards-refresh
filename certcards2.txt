A security administrator is concerned about data exfiltration resulting
from the use of malicious phone charging stations. Which of the
following would be the BEST way to protect against this threat?
A. USB data blocker
USB data blockers are physical USB cables that allow power connections
but prevent data connections. With a USB data blocker attached, any
power source can be used without a security concern.

A security analyst has identified a number of sessions from a single IP
address with a TTL equal to zero. One of the sessions has a destination of
the Internet firewall, and a session immediately after has a destination of
your DMZ server. Which of the following BEST describes this
log information?
he Answer: D. Someone is performing a traceroute to the DMZ server
A traceroute maps each hop by slowly incrementing the TTL (Time
to Live) value during each request. When the TTL reaches zero, the
receiving router drops the packet and sends an ICMP (Internet Control
Message Protocol) TTL Exceeded message back to the original station.

 A member of the accounting team was out of the office for two weeks,
and an important financial transfer was delayed until they returned.
Which of the following would have prevented this delay?
INCORRECT A. Split knowledge
The use of split knowledge limits the information that any one person
would know. In this example, having knowledge of part of the process
would not have helped with processing the financial transfer.

A designer-first integration service is a type of integration service that focuses on providing a user-friendly and design-centric interface for designers to connect different software tools and applications.

This type of service typically allows designers to create custom workflows and integrations between various tools without requiring any coding or technical expertise. It often provides drag-and-drop functionality and pre-built templates to simplify the integration process.

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used in text editors and web applications to format and style text. It was created by John Gruber in 2004 with the goal of allowing people to write using an easy-to-read, plain-text format that could then be converted into HTML.

Markdown uses simple syntax, such as asterisks for bold text and hyphens for lists, to indicate formatting. The resulting text is easy to read and write, making it a popular choice for technical documentation, blogging, and note-taking.

S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose internet Mail Extensions) is a widely accepted protocol for sending digitally signed and encrypted messages. S/MIME in Exchange Online provides the following services for email messages:

Encryption: Protects the content of email messages.
Digital signatures: Verifies the identity of the sender of an email message.

S/MIME is widely used in IT to secure email communication, especially in organizations that deal with sensitive or confidential information. However, it is important to note that both the sender and receiver must have S/MIME support and have exchanged digital certificates for this to work.

Domain
A sphere of knowledge, or a collection of facts about some program entities or a number of network points or addresses, identified by a name. On the Internet, a domain consists of a set of network addresses. In the Internet's domain name system, a domain is a name with which name server records are associated that describe sub-domains or host. In Windows NT and Windows 2000, a domain is a set of network resources (applications, printers, and so forth) for a group of users. The user need only to log in to the domain to gain access to the resources, which may be located on a number of different servers in the network.

Filtering Router
An inter-network router that selectively prevents the passage of data packets according to a security policy. A filtering router may be used as a firewall or part of a firewall. A router usually receives a packet from a network and decides where to forward it on a second network. A filtering router does the same, but first decides whether the packet should be forwarded at all, according to some security policy. The policy is implemented by rules (packet filters) loaded into the router.
