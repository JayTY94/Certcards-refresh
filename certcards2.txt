You can configure your policies so that, when a DLP policy is triggered, email notifications are sent automatically, and policy tips are shown to admins and end users. Policy tips are useful ways to raise awareness of risky behaviors on sensitive items and train users to avoid those behaviors in the future.





124
Microsoft Purview
When you create your DLP policies, you should consider rolling them out gradually, so you can assess their impact and test their effectiveness before fully enforcing them. For example, you don't want a new DLP policy to unintentionally block access to thousands of documents or to break an existing business process.

Microsoft Purview
When you create your sensitivity labels in the Microsoft Purview portal, they appear in a list on the Labels page from Information Protection. In this list, the order of the labels is important because it sets their priority. You want your most restrictive sensitivity label, such as Highly Confidential to appear at the bottom of the list and your least restrictive sensitivity label, such as Personal or Public, to appear at the top.





127
Microsoft Purview
DLP reports a vast amount of information to Microsoft Purview from monitoring policy matches and actions, to user activities. You need to consume and act on that information to tune your policies and triage actions taken on sensitive items. The telemetry goes into the Microsoft 365 audit Logs first, is processed, and makes its way to different reporting tools.

167
Power BI
Q: What role does Data Profiling in Power Query play when troubleshooting refresh issues?
A:

    Data Profiling (enable under View → Column quality/Column distribution) lets you see values, error rates, and distinct counts.

    Helps identify unexpected nulls, data type mismatches, or outliers that could increase transformation complexity or break folding.





168
Power BI
Q: What is “query folding” and why does it matter for refresh timeouts?
A: Query folding means pushing filtering/sorting logic down to the data source. If a step breaks folding, Power Query pulls all rows client-side, increasing data volume and risking timeouts.





169
Power BI
Q: Name one alternative to the SQL connector when connecting to Dataverse that can improve folding and avoid timeouts.
A: Use the built-in Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector via Get Data → Dataverse. It often auto-folds better into Dataverse’s paging model than the SQL (TDS) endpoint.





170
Power BI
What’s the scope of variables (VAR) inside an ADDCOLUMNS column definition?
A VAR declared inside one column’s definition lives only within that column. To share results, you must either repeat the logic or separate the columns into multiple ADDCOLUMNS calls so that the column values exist in the table.

Also called the “callback queue.” Holds callbacks from things like setTimeout, I/O events, and UI rendering.





244
JavaScript Concepts
To create a deep copy of an object in JavaScript, you can use the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object)) method. This approach works well for simple objects, such as those with string:number pairs, and ensures that the original object remains unmodified.





245
JavaScript Concepts
In many cases, it makes sense to assign a more appropriate default value than undefined. This can be done by specifying default parameters directly in the function definition.

function someName(param1 = defaultValue1, param2 = defaultValue2) {
  // ...
}

Power BI
Q: How do incremental refresh policies handle late-arriving data, and what can you do to mitigate missed updates?
    A:

    Incremental refresh typically uses a RangeStart/RangeEnd window; any rows older than RangeStart aren’t re-queried.

    To capture late-arriving updates, include a “stale data window” (e.g., overlapping dates) so you reprocess recent partitions that might receive back‐dated changes, then drop duplicates in Power Query or DAX.





288
Power BI
Q: What indicates a break in query folding when reviewing Query Diagnostics in Power Query?
A: In the “Folding” diagnostic table, any step marked “Not foldable” shows where folding stopped, meaning subsequent transformations happen client‐side.





289
Power BI
What is the difference between row context and filter context in DAX?
Row context iterates over rows (as in iterators like SUMX or SUMMARIZE), while filter context filters tables for evaluation (as in measures and visuals). CALCULATE is the primary way to convert row context into filter context and apply or modify filters.





290
Power BI
When would you use GENERATESERIES in DAX?
GENERATESERIES(start, end, increment) produces a single-column table of numeric values at the specified step size. It’s useful for creating bins or ranges (for example, percentage buckets) for frequency analysis.





291
Power BI
Q: What are the risks of using a static RangeStart parameter over a long period?
A: If you never update RangeStart, new “late-arriving” or back‐dated changes older than that date won’t be captured. You risk permanently missing updates unless you periodically advance the boundary.

398
Power BI
Q: Why might switching to the Dataverse (OData/CDS) connector improve performance over the SQL connector?
A: The Dataverse connector is designed to leverage server‐side paging and API optimizations, often preserving query folding more reliably and avoiding TDS‐related throttling.





399
Power BI
Q: What is the effect of data type mismatches on Power Query folding and performance?
    A:

    If you change a column’s data type (e.g., from text to date) before filtering, Power Query may break folding because the source might not support that conversion natively.

    Always apply type conversions at the end, after filters, or ensure the source can natively convert the type in the same query.

Windows PATH Variable
PATH Injection Risk
If a malicious directory is added early in PATH, it can override trusted executables.
Best practice: Keep system directories first and avoid adding writable folders.





582
Windows PATH Variable
Delimiter
The character used to separate multiple entries in the PATH variable. On Windows, this is a semicolon (;). Each directory in PATH must be separated by this character.

PATH Length and Performance
Very long PATH can slow down command resolution.
Tip: Remove unused entries and keep essential ones first.





584
Windows PATH Variable
Environment Scope defines where and how environment variables apply:

    Process Scope: Variables exist only for the current process.
    User Scope: Variables apply to the current user account.
    System Scope: Variables apply to all users on the machine.





585
Windows PATH Variable
Command Precedence
If two executables share the same name:
    The one in the first matching PATH directory wins.
    Use where.exe <command> or Get-Command <command> to check which one runs.

The business metadata includes automated (for example, promoted from Power BI datasets, or descriptions from SQL tables) and manual tagging of descriptions, glossary terms, and so on.





628
Microsoft Purview
Related to business domains are data products. A data product is a business construct with a name, description, owners, and most importantly a list of associated data assets. The data product provides context for the assets that are included within it, and provides a use case for data consumers.





629
Microsoft Purview
Running a scan invokes the process to ingest metadata from the registered data sources. The metadata curated at the end of the scan and curation process includes technical metadata. This metadata can include data asset names such as table names or file names, file size, columns, and data lineage

Azure Files Documentation
File shares (preview), offered by the Microsoft.FileShares resource provider. File shares are a new top-level resource that simplify the deployment of Azure Files by eliminating the storage account. Unlike classic file shares, which must be deployed into a storage account, file shares are deployed directly into the resource group like storage accounts themselves





632
Azure Files Documentation
The access tier of the file share dictates to the ratio of storage to IOPS/throughput costs (in the form of transactions). There are three access tiers: transaction optimized, hot, and cool. Changing the tier of the Azure file share results in transaction costs for the movement to the new access tier.





633
Azure Files Documentation
Using the storage account key to mount the Azure file share is effectively an administrator operation, because the mounted file share has full permissions to all of the files and folders on the share, even if they have ACLs. When using the storage account key to mount over SMB, the NTLMv2 authentication protocol is used.





634
Azure Files Documentation
Metadata caching is an enhancement for SSD Azure file shares that reduces metadata latency and raises metadata scale limits. The feature increases latency consistency and available IOPS, and it boosts network throughput.





635

Python
Q:
How does using yield from affect the performance of a generator?

A:
yield from can improve performance by delegating part of the generator’s operations to another generator, reducing overhead and simplifying code.

Example:
def generator1():
    yield from range(1000)

def generator2():
    yield from generator1()

# More efficient delegation





638
Python
Q:
What is the difference between itertools.accumulate() and itertools.reduce()?

A:
itertools.accumulate() returns an iterator that yields accumulated sums (or results of a specified function), while functools.reduce() applies a function cumulatively to the items of a sequence, reducing it to a single value.





639
Python
Q:
What is the difference between yield and return in a generator function?

Azure Files Documentation
SMB file shares communicate over port 445, which many organizations and internet service providers (ISPs) block for outbound (internet) traffic. This practice originates from legacy security guidance about deprecated and non-internet safe versions of the SMB protocol. SMB 3.x does not share these vulnerabilities.





675
Azure Files Documentation
In the OSI networking model, Microsoft SMB Protocol is most often used as an Application layer or a Presentation layer protocol, and it relies on lower-level protocols for transport.

Kerberos authentication is available with Active Directory using AES 256 encryption (recommended) and RC4-HMAC. AES 128 Kerberos encryption isn't yet supported.





703
Azure Files Documentation
In order to enable AES-256 encryption, the domain object that represents your storage account must be a computer account (default) or service logon account in the on-premises AD domain. If your domain object doesn't meet this requirement, delete it and create a new domain object that does.

with ExitStack() as stack:
    file1 = stack.enter_context(open('file1.txt'))
    file2 = stack.enter_context(open('file2.txt'))
    # Work with files





725
Python
import os
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def change_dir(destination):
    original_dir = os.getcwd()
    os.chdir(destination)
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        os.chdir(original_dir)

# Usage

You can enable identity-based authentication over SMB using one of three identity sources: On-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), Microsoft Entra Domain Services, or Microsoft Entra Kerberos (hybrid identities only). You can only use one identity source for file access authentication per storage account.





738
Azure Files Documentation
To enable AD DS authentication over SMB for Azure file shares, you need to register your Azure storage account with your on-premises AD DS and then set the required domain properties on the storage account. To register your storage account with AD DS, you create a computer account (or service logon account) representing it in your AD DS.

For production code, prefer if ...: raise ValueError or RuntimeError.





751
Python
Q:
How can generators be used to implement a producer-consumer pattern?

A:
Generators can act as producers by yielding data, which consumers can iterate over, allowing for efficient and decoupled data processing.

Example:
def producer():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i

def consumer(gen):
    for item in gen:
        print(f"Consumed: {item}")

gen = producer()
consumer(gen)





752
Python
Q:
Why should you prefer sys.exit() over exit() in production scripts?

A:
sys.exit() is more explicit and is the standard way to exit scripts, while exit() is intended for interactive shells and may not behave as expected in all environments.





753
Python
Front: What is the only requirement for an __init__.py file to turn a folder into a Python package?
Back: It can be completely empty—its mere presence signals Python that the folder is a package.





754
Python
Front: What should you do after getting the imports working with hacks, for cleaner long-term code?
Back: Rename folders to valid package names, add __init__.py files, and switch to proper package or absolute imports.

Python
What does the any() function do when used with a generator expression?

A:
It returns True if any element of the generator is True, otherwise False. It evaluates elements lazily and stops as soon as a True is found.

Example:
result = any(x > 10 for x in gen())





761
Python
Q:
How can you create mutually exclusive command-line arguments using argparse?

766
Python
Zip Slip (Path Traversal Attack)
Malicious zips can contain members like ../../etc/passwd.
Naïve extractall() writes outside the intended folder.
Fix: use Path.resolve() to normalize paths and ensure they remain within a safe directory.





767
Python
Path.resolve()
Converts a path into an absolute, normalized path.





768
Python
Q:
How can you memoize a generator function to cache its results?

A:
By using decorators like functools.lru_cache() on generator functions, although it's generally more suited for regular functions. For generators, you might need to implement custom caching.

Note:
functools.lru_cache() does not work directly with generator functions since they return iterators. Instead, consider converting the generator to a list and then caching.
