If an API has not been properly developed or tested, an attacker may be able to find a vulnerability that wouldn’t be able to use the functionality of the application, but it might be able to cause the application to fail. This would be a denial of service attack, and it would then prevent anyone else from gaining access to that application

If you configured multiple redirect URIs for the application, the authorization URL must include the redirect_uri parameter matching one of the URIs configured in the Box developer console. If the parameter is not specified, the user will see a redirect_uri_missing error and will not be redirected back to the app after granting application access.

One method used by attackers to be able to intercept and perhaps even change this API information, is an on-path attack. This is when the attacker sits in the middle of the conversation and is able to view all of the traffic going back and forth, and in many cases modify or replay some of the traffic it has seen in these API calls. This means that an attacker can sit in the middle of the conversation, get an understanding of the way the API operates, and then put their own data into the API flows.

The theory of the Diamond Model
This methodology underlines the relationships and characteristics of four components of the diamond—adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim. These four core elements are connected to delineate the relationship between each other which can be analytically examined to further uncover insights and gain knowledge of malicious activities.

When setting a Deadline or a Postpone date for an Orchestrator transaction, we recommend populating the respective fields with relative dates. For example, DateTime.Now.AddHours(2), DateTime.Now.AddDays(10) and DateTime.Now.Add(New System.TimeSpan(5, 0, 0, 0)). Additionally, you can use the US notation to add an exact time, such as 10/10/2019 07:40:00. Automatic correction of this date is available, for example, if you write 12 10 2019 9:0, it is automatically transformed to 12/10/2019 09:00:00.

Vertical Privilege Escalation
Vertical privilege escalation, also known as privilege elevation, is a term used in cybersecurity that refers to an attack that starts from a point of lower privilege, then escalates privileges until it reaches the level of the user or process it targets.




38
Security+
Horizontal Privilege Escalation
Horizontal privilege escalation means that a user will achieve access permissions belonging to another user that owns the same access level as the user that has started the cyberattack. It is a bit more challenging compared to vertical ones since they require a deep understanding of how operating systems work.

A common on-path attack on a local IP subnet is an ARP poisoning. This is an Address Resolution Protocol poisoning. And that’s because ARP, as a protocol, does not have any type of security associated with it. Devices receive and modify ARP tables without any type of authentication or any type of encryption. This would allow an attacker to send ARPs to any device on the local subnet, and those local devices would interpret the ARPs as if they were coming from a legitimate source.

An IT department doesn’t commonly operate in a vacuum. There are usually customers of IT that have applications, data, and other technical resources that the IT department is managing for them.

Most of this relationship building, though, doesn’t occur when an event happens, it occurs prior to the event. Often years before an event would occur. There’s ongoing communication and meetings to make sure that everyone is involved in the process. And if you do have a security exercise, it’s important to involve all of your stakeholders.

When a disaster or security incident occurs, we need to find some other way to get our job done. And often, this will require continuity of operations planning (COOP).

It’s important that the application developer understand exactly what input is being used, and how that input is being handled by the application.

Code Signing is similar to the process we use to provide encryption certificates on web servers. We first need a trusted certificate authority who’s going to sign the developer’s public key. The developer will then use their private key to digitally sign any code that they happen to be deploying. That means that you can validate that this code is exactly what was deployed by the original developer, by validating it with their public key.
