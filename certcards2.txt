Thomas Andrew Lehrer (/ˈlɛərər/; born April 9, 1928) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, satirist, and mathematician. He recorded pithy and humorous songs that became popular in the 1950s and 1960s. His songs often parodied popular musical forms, though they usually had original melodies. An exception is "The Elements", in which he set the names of the chemical elements to the tune of the "Major-General's Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance.

There’s functionality within the software of the switch itself that allows us to limit the number of broadcasts that can be sent in any particular second. Some of these switches can even provide control of multicast, and unicast as well.

Code Signing is similar to the process we use to provide encryption certificates on web servers. We first need a trusted certificate authority who’s going to sign the developer’s public key. The developer will then use their private key to digitally sign any code that they happen to be deploying. That means that you can validate that this code is exactly what was deployed by the original developer, by validating it with their public key.

Horizontal Privilege Escalation
Horizontal privilege escalation means that a user will achieve access permissions belonging to another user that owns the same access level as the user that has started the cyberattack. It is a bit more challenging compared to vertical ones since they require a deep understanding of how operating systems work.
