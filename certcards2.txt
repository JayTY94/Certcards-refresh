A sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund that is typically established by countries with large amounts of surplus income from natural resources, trade, or other sources. The purpose of a sovereign wealth fund is to invest the surplus income to generate long-term financial returns that can be used for various purposes such as supporting future generations, stabilizing the economy, or funding social welfare programs.

Measures in Microsoft Power BI models are either implicit or explicit. Implicit measures are automatic behaviors that allow visuals to summarize model column data. Explicit measures, also known simply as measures, are calculations that you can add to your model.

In tabular modeling, no such concept as a calculated measure exists. The word calculated is used to describe calculated tables and calculated columns. It distinguishes them from tables and columns that originate from Power Query, which doesn't have the concept of an explicit measure.

Which statement about measures is correct? 

Measures can reference other measures directly.
Measures can reference other measures. It's known as a compound measure.
NOT
Measures store values in the data model.
Measures must be added to the data model to achieve summarization.
Measures can reference columns directly.

The design of your service connections should meet your organization’s requirements. Some companies prefer to create service connections per subscription to control the exposure of any given service principal to a specific subscription. Having a proper design saves time and solves the problem of too many service connections.

When you reference a column in a formula, the column name must be enclosed within square brackets. Optionally, it can be preceded by its table name. For example, the following measure definition refers to the Sales Amount column.


  Revenue = SUM([Sales Amount])

We recommend that you use the DIVIDE function whenever the denominator is an expression that could return zero or BLANK. In this case, the division is guaranteed to succeed and pass an alternative value, and your expression will perform better because it will avoid unnecessary testing.

MS Data Analyst
Implicit measures don't work when the model is queried by using Multidimensional Expressions (MDX). This language expects explicit measures and can't summarize column data. It's used when a Power BI dataset is queried by using Analyze in Excel or when a Power BI paginated report uses a query that is generated by the MDX graphical query designer.





12

Notably, what-if calculated tables aren't related to other model tables because they're not used to propagate filters. For this reason, they're sometimes called disconnected tables.

Whitespace is optional and it doesn't modify your formula logic or negatively impact performance. We strongly recommend that you adopt a format style and apply it consistently, and consider the following recommendations:

  Use spaces between operators.
  Use tabs to indent nested function calls.
  Use carriage returns to separate function arguments, especially when it's too long to fit on a single line. Formatting in this way makes it simpler to troubleshoot, especially when the formula is missing a parenthesis.
  Err on the side of too much whitespace than too little.

4. You write a DAX formula that adds BLANK to the number 20. What will be the result? 

The result will be 20.
BLANK is converted to zero when added to a number.

3. You're using Power BI Desktop to develop a model. It has a table named Geography, which has two relationships to the Sales table. One relationship filters by customer region and the other filters by sales region. You need to create a role-playing dimension so that both filters are possible. What type of DAX calculation will you add to the model? 

A calculated table could create a table that duplicates the Geography table data. It could then have an active relationship to the Sales table. Both geography tables would have active relationships to allow report users to filter by customer region or sales region.

Two DAX functions are related to the BLANK data type: the BLANK DAX function returns BLANK, while the ISBLANK DAX function tests whether an expression evaluates to BLANK.

MS Data Analyst
A calculated table defined as a duplicate of another table only duplicates data; it doesn't duplicate any model properties or objects like column visibility or hierarchies. You'll need to set them up for the new table, if required.

An excellent formatting tool from another source that can help you format your calculations is DAX Formatter. This tool allows you to paste in your calculation and format it. You can then copy the formatted calculation to the clipboard and paste it back into Power BI Desktop.

The areas where calculated columns and measures differ include:

Purpose - Calculated columns extend a table with a new column, while measures define how to summarize model data.
Evaluation - Calculated columns are evaluated by using row context at data refresh time, while measures are evaluated by using filter context at query time.





21
MS Data Analyst
Because column names are unique within a table but not necessarily unique within the model, you can disambiguate the column reference by preceding it with its table name. This disambiguated column is known as a fully qualified column. Some DAX functions require passing in fully qualified columns.





22
MS Data Analyst
Remembering how BLANK is handled can be challenging, especially for DAX beginners. Consequently, we recommend that you test your formulas thoroughly. When BLANKs create unexpected results, consider using the IF and ISBLANK DAX functions to test for BLANK, and then respond in an appropriate way.

When writing a DAX formula that uses operators to combine different data types, you don't need to explicitly convert types. Usually, DAX automatically identifies the data types of referenced model objects and performs implicit conversions where necessary to complete the specified operation.

Model data types aren't the same as DAX data types, though a direct relationship exists between them.

Power BI Desktop supports a feature called What-if parameters. When you create a what-if parameter, a calculated table is automatically added to your model.

What-if parameters allow report users to select or filter by values that are stored in the calculated table. Measure formulas can use selected value(s) in a meaningful way.

BLANK is handled differently, depending on the operator that is used. It's handled similar to how Excel treats BLANK, but differently to how databases (SQL) treat NULL. BLANK is treated as zero when acted on by arithmetic operators and as an empty string when concatenated to a string.

If your formula needs to reference columns in other tables, and if the tables are related, directly or indirectly, you can use the RELATED or RELATEDTABLE DAX function. The RELATED function retrieves the value at the one-side of the relationship, while the RELATEDTABLE retrieves values on the many-side. The RELATEDTABLE function returns a table object.

If your formula needs to reference columns in other tbales and the tables aren't related, you can use the LOOKUPVALUE DAX function. Generally, try to use the RELATED function whenever possible. It will usually perform better than the LOOKUPVALUE function due to the ways that relationship and column data is stored and indexed.

3. You're developing a Power BI desktop model that sources data from an Excel workbook. The workbook has an employee table that stores one row for each employee. Each row has a reference to the employee's manager, which is also a row in the employee table. You need to add several columns to the Employee table in your model to analyze payroll data within the organization hierarchy (like, executive level, manager level, and so on). Which technique will you use to add the columns? 

You can use the DAX parent-child functions to naturalize the recursive (employee-manager) relationship into columns.
