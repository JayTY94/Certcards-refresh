Materiality Principle: This principle states that an item should only be included on the Balance aSheet if it would change any decisions of a statement user. For example, a multimillion dollar donating $100 to charity, this information would not change any decision that management or the owner would make. The expense should be recorded under "miscellaneous expense"

In an XML document or external entity, a CDATA section is a piece of element content that is marked up to be interpreted literally, as textual data, not as marked up content.[1] A CDATA section is merely an alternative syntax for expressing character data; there is no semantic difference between character data in a CDATA section and character data in standard syntax where, for example, "<" and "&" are represented by "&lt;" and "&amp;", respectively.
