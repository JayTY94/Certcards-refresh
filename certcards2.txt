 Wireless deauthentication is like a denial of service for a WAP that forces the client to attach to an evil twin that looks like the legitimate WAP. Once connected, the attacker can capture all of the information being sent through it. A sign of an evil twin is that internet access is slow but you cannot connect to the corporate network.

Moving laterally and attacking a host, virtual machine, or hypervisor is called VM escape. Moving laterally across a traditional network and attacking another host is called pivoting.

RAID 6 is a data storage approach that combines four or more hard drives into a single logical drive. Compared to individual data carriers, it boosts reliability of the system and read speeds. The basis for this is the combination of striping and parity, that also forms the basis of RAID level 5. It comes as little surprise then that RAID 6 is often referred to as “RAID 5 expansion”.

VM sprawl is where a virtual machine is running out of resources.
Privilege escalation occurs when someone has been given too many permissions.

In the process a user is redirected to the Box web app in a browser where they log in and authorize the application access to their data before they are redirected back to the applications redirect_url. This last step requires the application to be running on a web server somewhere accessible to the user.




2
8879 project
If you configured multiple redirect URIs for the application, the authorization URL must include the redirect_uri parameter matching one of the URIs configured in the Box developer console. If the parameter is not specified, the user will see a redirect_uri_missing error and will not be redirected back to the app after granting application access.

In Orchestrator, newly created queues are empty by default. To populate them with items you can either use the upload functionality in Orchestrator, or Studio activities. The latter also enable you to change item statuses and process them. As soon as queue items are processed, they become transactions.

Failed or abandoned queue items can be assigned to a reviewer, which can be changed or cleared at any point, if needed. Each of these changes are tracked in the History tab of the Audit Details window. The reviewer is in charge of assessing the current status of the transactions he is assigned to, and changing the review status.

To achieve better control in terms of Orchestrator performance, the Specific Data size of queue items is limited to 1 MB with the help of the Queue.MaxSpecificDataSizeInKiloBytes app setting. Anything beyond this limit cannot be added to a queue, and it returns the 403 - Payload Too Large error code.

The Transactions page displays the transactions from a given queue. It also shows their statuses, the dates when they should be processed, the Robot that processed them, and the type of exception thrown or assigned reference, if any.

When setting a Deadline or a Postpone date for an Orchestrator transaction, we recommend populating the respective fields with relative dates. For example, DateTime.Now.AddHours(2), DateTime.Now.AddDays(10) and DateTime.Now.Add(New System.TimeSpan(5, 0, 0, 0)). Additionally, you can use the US notation to add an exact time, such as 10/10/2019 07:40:00. Automatic correction of this date is available, for example, if you write 12 10 2019 9:0, it is automatically transformed to 12/10/2019 09:00:00.

 The Priority of the items added in a queue after enabling SLA predictions is automatically set to High, regardless of how it was set in Studio or in the .csv file used for upload.

 You cannot delete a process associated to a queue with enabled SLA predictions.

8879 project
 If at least one queue item exceeds its deadline, Over Capacity is displayed in the Necessary Robots (SLA) column and predictions are no longer calculated.

 Predictions are made for queue items with deadlines in the next 24 hours (can be changed using the Queue.SlaReadaheadTimeLimitHours, and do not take into account the items' defer dates.

In order to specify custom Item/Transaction fields for this project, I had to create a JSON schema document (on jsonschema.net/app/) to upload to the "Specific Data JSON Schema" field. There was a link to a web app for the creation of this document in the article "About Queues and Transactions".
