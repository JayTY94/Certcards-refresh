FSLogix
Data is written to all storage providers regardless of which provider is used during data hydration.
Performance (latency, utilization, bottlenecks) of a storage provider affects its sync status with the local copy.
Having one (1) or more provider that is behind in updates from local cache could be an indicator of an under performing storage provider.





392
FSLogix
Antivirus Software Exclusions for FSLogix Container Files:
A best practice in FSLogix deployments. It involves configuring antivirus software to exclude FSLogix container files (both Profile and Office Containers stored in VHD/VHDX format) from scanning. This prevents potential performance degradation and issues during file access.





393
FSLogix
All data written to the user's profile is temporarily stored as block-level cache objects in the same directory. Those block-level cache objects are then committed to the local cache. Before the block-level cache objects are created, the writes into the user's profile are processed in memory through a proxy file.





394
FSLogix
A full VHD(x) clone is performed when Cloud Cache determines, at sign in, that a storage provider isn't at the same sequence. During this operation, all pending writes are kept in the local cache until all storage providers are at the same sequence. Once complete, the flush operation begins sending new data to the storage providers.
