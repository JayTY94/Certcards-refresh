It's a best practice to avoid writing SQL queries directly in Power BI. Instead, consider writing a query like this in a view. A view is an object in a relational database, similar to a table. Views have rows and columns, and can contain almost every operator in the SQL language. If Power BI uses a view, when it retrieves data, it participates in query folding, a feature of Power Query.

When you're creating a dashboard in Power BI, you can move or arrange tiles however you want. You can make them bigger, change their height or width, and snuggle them up to other tiles.

When you're viewing, or consuming, a dashboard or report—which means you're not the creator or owner, but the report or dashboard has been shared with you—you can interact with it, but you can't change the size of the tiles or their arrangement.

It's important to note that while parameters can be a powerful tool for creating dynamic reports, they can also add complexity to your data model. You'll want to make sure you're using parameters effectively and efficiently to avoid performance issues. Additionally, not all data sources may support parameters, so it's important to check the documentation for your specific data source to see if parameters are supported.

Your Excel files might exist in one of the following locations:
OneDrive for Business - You can pull data from OneDrive for Business into Power BI. This method is effective in keeping an Excel file and your dataset, reports, and dashboards in Power BI synchronized. Power BI connects regularly to your file on OneDrive. If any changes are found, your dataset, reports, and dashboards are automatically updated in Power BI.





20
Microsoft Data Analyst
You can use parameters by determining the values that you want to see data for in the report, and the report updates accordingly by filtering the data for you.

Creating dynamic reports allows you to give users more power over the data that is displayed in your reports; they can change the data source and filter the data by themselves.

Authentication method(s) for SQL Server databases in Power BI:
Database - Use your database credentials. For instance, SQL Server has its own sign-in and authentication system that is sometimes used. If the database administrator gave you a unique sign-in to the database, you might need to enter those credentials on the Database tab.

An app is a collection of preset, ready-made visuals and reports that are shared with an entire organization. Using an app is like microwaving a TV dinner or ordering a fast-food value meal: you just have to press a few buttons or make a few comments, and you're quickly served a collection of entrees designed to go together, all presented in a tidy, ready-to-consume package.





26
Azure Pipelines
Pipelines rely on resources such as environments, service connections, agent pools, variable groups, and secure files. Checks enable the resource owner to control if and when a stage in any pipeline can consume a resource. As an owner of a resource, you can define checks that must be satisfied before a stage consuming that resource can start.

Your Excel files might exist in one of the following locations:
SharePoint - Team Sites - Saving your Power BI Desktop files to SharePoint Team Sites is similar to saving to OneDrive for Business. The main difference is how you connect to the file from Power BI. You can specify a URL or connect to the root folder.





28
Microsoft Data Analyst
An important and enabling part of Power BI is the multitude of data connectors that are included. Whether the data you want is in Excel or a Microsoft SQL Server database, in Azure or Oracle, or in a service like Facebook, Salesforce, or MailChimp, Power BI has built-in data connectors that let you easily connect to that data, filter it if necessary, and bring it into your dataset.

After the database has been connected to Power BI Desktop, the Navigator window displays the data that is available in your data source (the SQL database in this example). You can select a table or entity to preview its contents and make sure that the correct data will be loaded into the Power BI model.





30
Azure Pipelines
A stage can consist of many jobs, and each job can consume several resources. Before the execution of a stage can begin, all checks on all the resources used in that stage must be satisfied. Azure Pipelines pauses the execution of a pipeline prior to each stage, and waits for all pending checks to be completed.

SQL
SELECT * FROM SALES

The wildcard character (*) will import all characters from within the Sales table. This method isn't recommended because it will lead to redundant data in your model, which will cause performance issues and require extra steps to normalize your data for reporting.





32
Azure Pipelines
A pipeline is made up of stages. A pipeline author can control whether a stage should run by defining conditions on the stage. Another way to control if and when a stage should run is through approvals and checks.

Upside
In private equity, funds and investors seek out underperforming or undervalued companies that they can take private and turn around, before going public years later. Buyout firms are involved in management buyouts (MBOs), in which the management of the company being purchased takes a stake. They often play key roles in leveraged buyouts, which are buyouts that are funded with borrowed money.

The three different types of storage modes you can choose from:

Import
DirectQuery
Dual (Composite)

Connect live is an option for Azure Analysis Services. Azure Analysis Services uses the tabular model and DAX to build calculations, similar to Power BI. These models are compatible with one another. Using the Connect live option helps you keep the data and DAX calculations in their original location, without having to import them all into Power BI.

Azure Analysis Services is available in Developer, Basic, and Standard tiers. Within each tier, plan costs vary according to processing power, Query Processing Units (QPUs), and memory size. When you create a server, you select a plan within a tier. You can change plans up or down within the same tier, or upgrade to a higher tier, but you can't downgrade from a higher tier to a lower tier.

Azure Analysis Services uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for identity management and user authentication. Any user creating, managing, or connecting to an Azure Analysis Services server must have a valid user identity in an Azure AD tenant in the same subscription.






7
Microsoft Data Analyst
To connect with Azure Analysis Services, Power BI Desktop, Visual Studio, and SSMS support Active Directory Universal Authentication, an interactive method that also supports Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). Azure AD MFA helps safeguard access to data and applications while providing a simple sign in process.

In Azure Analysis Services, the compatibility level refers to release-specific behaviors in the Analysis Services engine. For example, DirectQuery and tabular object metadata have different implementations depending on the compatibility level. In-general, you should choose the latest compatibility level supported by your platform.

Query folding is the process by which the transformations and edits that you make in Power Query Editor are simultaneously tracked as native queries, or simple Select SQL statements, while you're actively making transformations. 




11
Microsoft Data Analyst
All DirectQuery and Dual storage mode data sources must have the back-end server processing abilities to create a direct connection, which means that query folding is an automatic capability that you can use. If all transformations can be reduced to a single Select statement, then query folding can occur.




12
Microsoft Data Analyst
A good guideline to remember is that if you can translate a transformation into a Select SQL statement, which includes operators and clauses such as GROUP BY, SORT BY, WHERE, UNION ALL, and JOIN, you can use query folding.
