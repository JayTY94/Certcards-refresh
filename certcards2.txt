git push: This command uploads your local repository changes to a remote repository. It's used to share your changes with others.




13
OAuth2.0
To learn who the user is before redeeming an authorization code, it's common for applications to also request an ID token when they request the authorization code. This approach is called the hybrid flow because it mixes OIDC with the OAuth2 authorization code flow.




14
MS Identity Platform
OAuth versus OpenID Connect: The platform uses OAuth for authorization and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. OpenID Connect is built on top of OAuth 2.0, so the terminology and flow are similar between the two. You can even both authenticate a user (through OpenID Connect) and get authorization to access a protected resource that the user owns (through OAuth 2.0) in one request.

Python
In Python, you can compare sequences of the same type. When comparing two sequences, the first 
non-equal
 value determines the outcome.

For example, consider the following lists:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
more_numbers = [1, 2, 2, 10, 20]
When you compare these lists, you’ll find that numbers is greater than more_numbers.

Python
The re.sub function replaces all occurrences of a specified pattern in a string with a given replacement by default. If you want to replace only the first instance, you can use the count parameter and set it to 1.




25
sklearn
The k-means algorithm divides a set of N samples into X an K disjoint clusters C, each described with the mean mu_j of the samples in the cluster. The means are commonly called the cluster "centroids"; note that they are not, in general, points from X, although they live in the same space.




26
Python
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so replacing the "var" function with "std" is the best approach.

You could calculate the square roots of the existing pivot table data, but this complicates the code.

Python
One common way to customize a GET request is to pass values through query string parameters in the URL. To do this using get(), you pass data to params. For example, you can use GitHub’s repository search API to look for popular Python repositories:

import requests

# Search GitHub's repositories for popular Python projects
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.github.com/search/repositories",
    params={"q": "language:python", "sort": "stars", "order": "desc"},

Kaggle
Moving Average Plots
To see what kind of trend a time series might have, we can use a moving average plot. To compute a moving average of a time series, we compute the average of the values within a sliding window of some defined width. The idea is to smooth out any short-term fluctuations in the series so that only long-term changes remain.




44
Azure Storage
Each storage account requires some time and attention from an administrator to create and maintain. It also increases complexity for anyone who adds data to your cloud storage. Everyone in an administrator role needs to understand the purpose of each storage account so they add new data to the correct account.

67
Azure Functions
Functions are event driven. They run only in response to an event (called a "trigger"), such as receiving an HTTP request, or a message being added to a queue. You configure a trigger as part of the function definition. This approach simplifies your code by allowing you to declare where the data comes from (trigger/input binding) and where it goes (output binding). You don't need to write code to watch queues, blobs, hubs, and so on. You can focus purely on the business logic.




68
Power BI
Creating POST Requests in Power Query: You can modify Power Query M code to create a POST request by specifying the endpoint URL, headers (such as Content-Type: application/json), and request body.

Given enough time, K-means will always converge, however this may be to a local minimum. This is highly dependent on the initialization of the centroids. As a result, the computation is often done several times, with different initializations of the centroids. One method to help address this issue is the k-means++ initialization scheme, which has been implemented in scikit-learn (use the init='k-means++' parameter).

sklearn
By default, parameter search uses the score function of the estimator to evaluate a parameter setting. These are the sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score for classification and sklearn.metrics.r2_score for regression. For some applications, other scoring functions are better suited (for example in unbalanced classification, the accuracy score is often uninformative). An alternative scoring function can be specified via the scoring parameter of most parameter search tools.

‘L’esprit de l’escalier’ - literally meaning 'staircase wit’ - is a French phrase sometimes used in English to describe the frustration of thinking of the perfect reply or rebuttal - but only when it’s too late.

The name for this irritating situation - which most of us have found ourselves in (usually in the workplace) - was coined by the French philosopher Denis Diderot, when he found himself in such a predicament during a dinner held by statesman Jacques Necker.




212
Azure Functions 
Just like the other triggers we've seen so far, you can create a blob trigger in the Azure portal. Inside your Azure function, select Blob trigger from the list of predefined trigger types. Then, enter the logic that you want to execute when a blob is created or updated.

One setting that's important to understand is the Path. The Path tells the blob trigger which blob container to monitor to see if a blob is uploaded or updated. By default, the Path value is:

samples-workitems/{name}

Power BI
If there are data sources being accessed within the partition, and data flowing in from other partitions, the Firewall loses its ability to be the gatekeeper, since the data flowing in could be leaked to one of the internally accessed data sources without it knowing about it. Thus the Firewall prevents a partition that accesses other partitions from being allowed to directly access any data sources.




215
MS Identity Platform
If your desktop or mobile application runs on Windows and on a machine connected to a Windows domain (Active Directory or Microsoft Entra joined) it is possible to use the Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) to acquire a token silently. No UI is required when using the application.




216
Azure Storage
If a change to one piece of data must result in a change to another piece of data, an application needs to group together a series of data updates. You can use transactions to group these updates. In a transaction, if one event in a series of updates fails, the entire series can be rolled back or undone.




217
Conditional Access
Report-only: Success	
All configured policy conditions, required non-interactive grant controls, and session controls were satisfied. For example, a multifactor authentication requirement is satisfied by an MFA claim already present in the token, or a compliant device policy is satisfied by performing a device check on a compliant device.




218
OData

Python
Because the decoding of bytes to a str requires an encoding scheme, Requests will try to guess the encoding based on the response’s headers if you don’t specify one. You can provide an explicit encoding by setting .encoding before accessing .text:

>>> response.encoding = "utf-8"  # Optional: Requests infers this.
>>> response.text
'{"current_user_url":"https://api.github.com/user", ...}'




253
MS Identity Platform
Resource owner - The resource owner in an auth flow is usually the application user, or end-user in OAuth terminology. The end-user "owns" the protected resource (their data) which your app accesses on their behalf. The resources owners can grant or deny your app (the client) access to the resources they own. For example, your app might call an external system's API to get a user's email address from their profile on that system.




254
OData
$filter
The $filter query option allows clients to filter or narrow down the data returned from an OData service. It enables the use of conditions to specify which entities should be included in the response, for example, selecting customers whose age is greater than 30.

Python
Authentication helps a service understand who you are. Typically, you provide your credentials to a server by passing data through the Authorization header or a custom header defined by the service. All the functions of Requests that you’ve seen to this point provide a parameter called auth, which allows you to pass your credentials:

>>> import requests

>>> response = requests.get(
...     "https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd",
...     auth=("user", "passwd")
... )

The common practice is to use lists for homogeneous objects and tuples for heterogeneous objects. Lists are typically used when all elements are of the same type, while tuples are used when elements are of different types.




259
MS Identity Platform
Authentication scenarios involve two activities:

Acquiring security tokens for a protected web API: We recommend that you use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL), developed and supported by Microsoft.
Protecting a web API or a web app: One challenge of protecting these resources is validating the security token. On some platforms, Microsoft offers middleware libraries.




260
Python
Augmented assignment operators provide a more concise way to update the value of a variable. For example, counter += 1 is a shorthand for counter = counter + 1.

These operators rely on special methods like .__iadd__() for in-place operations. If the data type is mutable, then Python performs the operation in place. If the data type is immutable, Python returns a new object with the updated value.




261
Power BI
Power BI and API Calls: Power BI supports REST API calls, allowing data import from web services. The built-in Web connector is used for API integration but primarily supports GET requests.

A timer trigger is a trigger that executes a function at a consistent interval. To create a timer trigger, you need to supply two pieces of information:

A Timestamp parameter name, which is simply an identifier to access the trigger in code.
A Schedule, which is a CRON expression that sets the interval for the timer.




274
Azure Functions
A trigger is an object that defines a specific function. For example, if you want a function to execute every 10 minutes, you could use a timer trigger.

Every function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to execute a piece of logic that runs under multiple conditions, you need to create multiple functions that share the same core function code.

Power BI Desktop
Storage mode: With storage mode, you can now specify which visuals require a query to back-end data sources. Visuals that don't require a query are imported even if they're based on DirectQuery. This feature helps improve performance and reduce back-end load. Previously, even simple visuals, such as slicers, initiated queries that were sent to back-end sources.




309
Python
When you try to create an instance of a class that inherits from the Sequence abstract base class, but doesn’t implement .__getitem__() and .__len__(), then Python raises a TypeError:

The Sequence abstract base class requires that any class that inherits from it must implement the .__getitem__() and .__len__() methods.




310
Power BI
Transforming API Data into Usable Tables: API responses often contain nested structures (e.g., records, lists). In Power BI, you use the Expand functionality to convert these structures into tables, making the data easier to manipulate. Data transformation may include renaming columns, changing data types, or removing unnecessary fields.




311
Azure Pipelines
Job
A build contains one or more jobs. Most jobs run on an agent. A job represents an execution boundary of a set of steps. All the steps run together on the same agent.

For example, you might build two configurations - x86 and x64. In this case, you have one build and two jobs.




312
sklearn
Scikit-learn also provides the HalvingGridSearchCV and HalvingRandomSearchCV estimators that can be used to search a parameter space using successive halving [1] [2]. Successive halving (SH) is like a tournament among candidate parameter combinations. SH is an iterative selection process where all candidates (the parameter combinations) are evaluated with a small amount of resources at the first iteration.




313
OData
$orderby
The $orderby query option lets clients specify the order in which the data should be returned. For instance, you can use it to sort a list of entities in ascending or descending order based on specific properties, such as sorting products by price.




314
OData
2. Entity
An entity in OData represents a single piece of data, like a row in a database table. Each entity has a unique identifier (key) and contains various properties, which represent the individual attributes or fields of the data, such as name, age, or status.




315
Azure Functions
Trigger types and purpose:
Event Hub: Execute a function when an event hub receives a new event
Event Grid:	Execute a function based on Event Grid subscriptions




316
Conditional Access
Token Renewal: Refresh tokens are used to obtain new access and refresh token pairs when the current access token expires.
Token Lifetime: The default lifetime for refresh tokens is 24 hours for single-page applications and 90 days for other scenarios.




317
MS Identity Platform
The redirect URIs to use in a desktop application depend on the flow you want to use.

Specify the redirect URI for your app by configuring the platform settings for the app in App registrations in the Microsoft Entra admin center.

For apps that use Web Authentication Manager (WAM), redirect URIs need not be configured in MSAL, but they must be configured in the app registration.




318
Conditional Access
Find more information about the problem by clicking More Details in the initial error page. Clicking More Details will reveal troubleshooting information that's helpful when searching the Microsoft Entra sign-in events for the specific failure event the user saw or when opening a support incident with Microsoft.

Azure Functions Quickstart
We recommend setting up continuous deployment so that your function app in Azure is updated when you update source files in the connected source location. You can also deploy your project files from Visual Studio Code. When you publish from Visual Studio Code, you can take advantage of the Zip deploy technology.




320
sklearn
When evaluating the resulting model it is important to do it on held-out samples that were not seen during the grid search process: it is recommended to split the data into a development set (to be fed to the GridSearchCV instance) and an evaluation set to compute performance metrics.




321
Git
git pull: This command fetches and integrates changes from a remote repository into your local repository. It's a combination of git fetch and git merge.




322
Python
When you make a request, the Requests library prepares the request before actually sending it to the destination server. Request preparation includes things like validating headers and serializing JSON content.

You can view the PreparedRequest object by accessing .request on a Response object:

Azure
I figured out how to export the sign-in logs! I need to create a diagnostic setting from the sign in log page in the Entra admin center and point it at an azure log analytics resource. It looks like there was about a 5 minute delay.




324
Power BI
Power Query Response Parsing: After receiving the API response, Power BI parses the data using Json.Document(). You can expand and transform nested records and lists within the Power Query Editor. This enables you to prepare the data for visualizations or further analysis within Power BI.




325
sklearn 
RepeatedKFold: This extends KFold by repeating the cross-validation process several times with different random shuffles, which offers more robust estimates of model performance, especially useful for small datasets where variability in results could be high.




326
sklearn 
When the cv argument is an integer, cross_val_score uses the KFold or StratifiedKFold strategies by default, the latter being used if the estimator derives from ClassifierMixin.

from sklearn import metrics
scores = cross_val_score(
    clf, X, y, cv=5, scoring='f1_macro')
scores
array([0.96..., 1.  ..., 0.96..., 0.96..., 1.        ])




327
Azure CLI
Add the flag --validate to keep the Azure CLI command (Bash!) to keep from actually deploying.




328
Workera.ai
Azure DevTest Labs enables quick provisioning of resources such as virtual machines, allowing development and testing teams to create environments on-demand. This is particularly useful for scenarios where teams need to replicate production environments for testing purposes.




329
sklearn
Neighbors-based classification is computed from a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors of each point: a query point is assigned the data class which has the most representatives within the nearest neighbors of the point.




330
Conditional Access
Report-only: Not applied	
Not all configured policy conditions were satisfied. For example, the user is excluded from the policy or the policy only applies to certain trusted named locations.




331
MS Identity Platform
Integrated Windows Authentication has been replaced with a more reliable way of getting tokens silently - WAM. WAM can login the current windows user silently. This workflow does not require complex setup and it even works for personal (Microsoft) accounts. Internally, the Windows Broker (WAM) will try several strategies to get a token for the current Windows user, including IWA and redeeming the PRT. This eliminates most of the limitations with IWA.




332
Azure Functions Quickstart
Purpose: Meta-packages are often used to provide a convenient way to install a set of packages that are commonly used together. This can be particularly useful in complex environments where multiple packages are needed to provide full functionality.




333
sklearn 
ShuffleSplit: ShuffleSplit randomly splits the data multiple times into training and test sets, allowing control over the number of splits, training/test set sizes, and randomization. It’s versatile and works well for datasets with no inherent ordering or stratification needs.




334
Python
Remember that the initialization function in a class is named __init__() with 2 underscores before and after the word init. I tried to declare a class with 3 once, and it was embarrassing.




335
OData Requests
JSON null:
The JSON equivalent of Python's None, used to represent missing or undefined data. It’s essential to replace invalid values like NaN with null in JSON payloads to avoid request errors.




336
Git
git branch: This command lists, creates, or deletes branches. Branches are used to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment without affecting the main codebase.




337
Power Platform
UI Component: View
Views define how a list of rows for a specific table is displayed in your application. A view defines the columns to display, width of each column, sort behavior, and the default filters.




338
Dataverse
To successfully connect to your Dataverse, you must first register an app with Entra ID, which you can complete in the Azure portal. Depending on the type of app that you want to make, a few different settings are available for you to configure (web apps versus native apps that are installed natively on a device). For more information on settings required for each type, see Types of app registration.




339
OData
Action
Actions in OData are operations that can perform modifications on the data, such as updating entities, triggering workflows, or processing business logic. Unlike functions, actions can alter the data or system state and are invoked through POST requests.




340
Power BI
The SUMMARIZE function in DAX is a powerful function used to create summary tables or groupings of data based on specified columns and expressions. It essentially performs a GROUP BY operation similar to SQL.




341
sklearn
The cv_results_ attribute contains useful information for analyzing the results of a search. It can be converted to a pandas dataframe with df = pd.DataFrame(est.cv_results_). The cv_results_ attribute of HalvingGridSearchCV and HalvingRandomSearchCV is similar to that of GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV, with additional information related to the successive halving process.




342
Python
Named replacement fields allow you to insert values from a dictionary into a string by using keys. This method is more readable and intuitive than using positional arguments with tuples.




343
Power BI
The improved usage metrics report includes the following report pages:

Report usage Provides information about report views and report viewers, such as how many users viewed the report by date.
Report performance Shows the typical report opening times broken down by consumption method and browser types.
FAQ Provides answers to frequently asked questions, such as What is a "Viewer" and what is a "View"?




344
UHero Requests
Custom Components (Angular):
Custom components are reusable blocks of code in frameworks like Angular that define new HTML elements. They encapsulate logic, styling, and behavior, making it difficult to scrape using traditional methods like targeting <table> or <div> tags.




345
DNS
• DNS Forwarding:
The process of forwarding DNS queries from one DNS server to another, often used in corporate networks to ensure that all DNS traffic passes through a specific DNS server.

You can increase or decrease the size of icons on your desktop by selecting the desktop, holding [ctrl], and using the scroll wheel.




347
MS Identity Platform
Authorization server - The Microsoft identity platform is the authorization server. Also called an identity provider or IdP, it securely handles the end-user's information, their access, and the trust relationships between the parties in the auth flow. The authorization server issues the security tokens your apps and APIs use for granting, denying, or revoking access to resources (authorization) after the user has signed in (authenticated).




348
Azure Pipelines
Trigger
A trigger is set up to tell the pipeline when to run. You can configure a pipeline to run upon a push to a repository at scheduled times or upon completing another build. All these actions are known as triggers.




349
Dataverse
Bearer Token:

Definition: A type of token used in OAuth2 that authorizes access to resources like APIs.
Context: The token obtained from Azure AD that you include in the Authorization header for your API requests.




350
Dataverse
Authorization Code Flow:

Definition: An OAuth2 flow used by public clients (like single-page apps or mobile apps) where the user signs in interactively, providing credentials, and possibly undergoing multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Context: We discussed this flow as an alternative to the Client Credentials Flow because you wanted MFA to be required.

Python
Python fully supports arithmetic between ints and floats. It will convert narrower numbers to match their less narrow counterparts when used with the binary arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, and %). When division with /, // returns the quotient and % returns the remainder. Python considers ints narrower than floats. So, using a float in an expression ensures the result will be a float too. However, when doing division, the result will always be a float, even if only integers are used.

Power BI
To define a column in Power BI (DAX) that takes the non-blank value between two existing columns, or remains blank if both are blank, you can use the COALESCE function. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

NewColumn = COALESCE([Column1], [Column2])

GitHub codespaces
The configuration files for a dev container are contained in a .devcontainer directory in your repository. You can use Visual Studio Code to add configuration files for you. You can choose from a selection of predefined configurations for various project types





873
GitHub codespaces
The primary file in a dev container configuration is the devcontainer.json file. You can use this file to determine the environment of codespaces created for your repository. The contents of this file define a dev container that can include frameworks, tools, extensions, and port forwarding. The devcontainer.json file usually contains a reference to a Dockerfile, which is typically located alongside the devcontainer.json file.




873
GitHub codespaces
You can use a dotfiles repository and Settings Sync to personalize aspects of the codespace environment for any codespace that you create. Personalization can include shell preferences and additional tools. For more information, see "Personalizing GitHub Codespaces for your account."
