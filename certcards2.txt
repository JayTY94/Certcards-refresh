RAG
Modify query with history
The first step in the flow is a Large Language Model (LLM) node that takes the chat history and the user's last question and generates a new question that includes all necessary information. By doing so, you generate more succinct input that is processed by the rest of the flow.
Look up relevant information
Next, you use the Index Lookup tool to query the search index you created with the integrated Azure AI Search feature and find the relevant information from your data source.

Authentication helps a service understand who you are. Typically, you provide your credentials to a server by passing data through the Authorization header or a custom header defined by the service. All the functions of Requests that you’ve seen to this point provide a parameter called auth, which allows you to pass your credentials:

>>> import requests

>>> response = requests.get(
...     "https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd",
...     auth=("user", "passwd")
... )

Power BI
At its most basic level, a partition is just a collection of one or more query steps. The most granular partition possible (at least in the current implementation) is a single step. The largest partitions can sometimes encompass multiple queries.




126
Python
By default, Requests will wait indefinitely on the response, so you should almost always specify a timeout duration to prevent these issues from happening. To set the request’s timeout, use the timeout parameter. timeout can be an integer or float representing the number of seconds to wait on a response before timing out:

requests.get("https://api.github.com", timeout=1)
requests.get("https://api.github.com", timeout=3.05)




127
sklearn
The k-means algorithm divides a set of N samples into X an K disjoint clusters C, each described with the mean mu_j of the samples in the cluster. The means are commonly called the cluster "centroids"; note that they are not, in general, points from X, although they live in the same space.




128
Python
If you invoke Response.raise_for_status(), then Requests will raise an HTTPError for status codes between 400 and 600. If the status code indicates a successful request, then the program will proceed without raising that exception.




129
Power BI
A warning with query diagnostics, as mentioned elsewhere, is that you'll see drastically different capabilities depending on the connector. For example, many ODBC based connectors won't have an accurate recording of what query is send to the actual backend system, as Power Query only sees what it sends to the ODBC driver.

199
Python
Because the decoding of bytes to a str requires an encoding scheme, Requests will try to guess the encoding based on the response’s headers if you don’t specify one. You can provide an explicit encoding by setting .encoding before accessing .text:

>>> response.encoding = "utf-8"  # Optional: Requests infers this.
>>> response.text
'{"current_user_url":"https://api.github.com/user", ...}'

Kaggle
Once we've identified the shape of the trend, we can attempt to model it using a time-step feature. We've already seen how using the time dummy itself will model a linear trend:
target = a * time + b

We can fit many other kinds of trend through transformations of the time dummy. If the trend appears to be quadratic (a parabola), we just need to add the square of the time dummy to the feature set, giving us:
target = a * time ** 2 + b * time + c

Every function must have exactly one trigger associated with it. If you want to execute a piece of logic that runs under multiple conditions, you need to create multiple functions that share the same core function code.




212
Dataverse Queries
Entity Bound Actions
Definition: These are custom or system-defined actions that are tied to a specific entity and can be invoked via the Web API to perform tasks or trigger workflows.
Relevance: Entity-bound actions are useful for performing more complex business logic or automation that is triggered based on a record in an entity. For example, triggering a workflow on an engagement task when it's completed.

Azure Resource Providers are essentially services within the Azure ecosystem that manage specific types of Azure resources. When you interact with Azure, whether through the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, REST APIs, or SDKs, you're often dealing with these resources. Each resource provider specializes in a particular category of resources, such as virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, etc.

Site Scraping
I had to use the os.path abspath function to get the absolute path of the file I created for the sake of sending it as an email attachment.
  from os.path import abspath
  ...
  newmail.Attachments.Add(Source = abspath(relative_output_path))
  newmail.Send()




215
Azure CLI
Add the flag --validate to keep the Azure CLI command (Bash!) to keep from actually deploying.




216
Conditional Access
Creating a policy for each app isn’t efficient and leads to difficult administration. Conditional Access has a limit of 195 policies per-tenant. This 195 policy limit includes Conditional Access policies in any state including report-only mode, on, or off.




217
Python
When a request fails, you may want your application to retry the same request. However, Requests won’t do this for you by default. To apply this functionality, you need to implement a custom transport adapter.

Transport adapters let you define a set of configurations for each service that you’re interacting with.




218
OAuth2.0
client_secret	required for confidential web apps	
The application secret that you created in the app registration portal for your app. Don't use the application secret in a native app or single page app because a client_secret can't be reliably stored on devices or web pages. It's required for web apps and web APIs, which can store the client_secret securely on the server side. Like all parameters here, the client secret must be URL-encoded before being sent. This step is done by the SDK.




219
sklearn
The KMeans algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares (see below). This algorithm requires the number of clusters to be specified. It scales well to large numbers of samples and has been used across a large range of application areas in many different fields.

Site Scraping
Use Selenium to navigate to desirable data - this involved moving the driver focus to iframes and then interacting with elements there
  iframe = driver.find_elements(By.ID, 'tool')[0]
  driver.switch_to.frame(iframe)
  ...
  driver.switch_to.parent_frame()
  driver.switch_to.frame('data')
  sleep(3)




221
OData
Metadata Document
In OData, the metadata document describes the structure of the OData service, including the entity types, relationships, and properties. It is expressed in an XML format and allows developers and tools to understand the underlying schema of the OData service for integration purposes.




222
Python
The load_tests() function in Python’s unittest framework is a hook for customizing test loading and suite creation. It takes three arguments: a test loader, a series of tests, and a test discovery pattern. When you call unittest.main(), load_tests() gets called automatically.




223
Azure AI Search
Azure AI Search (formerly known as "Azure Cognitive Search") provides secure information retrieval at scale over user-owned content in traditional and conversational search applications.




224
OData
Action
Actions in OData are operations that can perform modifications on the data, such as updating entities, triggering workflows, or processing business logic. Unlike functions, actions can alter the data or system state and are invoked through POST requests.




225
Azure Storage
Transactional databases are often called online transaction processing (OLTP) systems. OLTP systems commonly support many users, have quick response times, and handle large volumes of data. They also are highly available, which means they have minimal downtime. OLTP systems typically handle small transactions or relatively simple transactions.
An example of an Azure service that supports OLTP is Azure SQL Database.




226
Python
The CRUD operations correspond almost one-to-one with SQL commands:

Create: INSERT
Read: SELECT
Update: UPDATE
Delete: DELETE
So, to modify existing data in SQL, you would use the UPDATE command.




227
pandas
Handling Empty Lists and Missing Data in explode: The explode method gracefully handles empty lists and missing values (NaN) when you use DataFrame.explode. Empty lists result in no additional rows, while NaN values are propagated, ensuring DataFrame consistency after the operation.




228
PP365
Background operations (optional)	Select to disable all asynchronous operations (see Asynchronous service) such as workflows and synchronization with Exchange. Emails will not be sent and server-side synchronization for appointments, contacts, and tasks are disabled. Note: Administration mode must be enabled to disable background operations.




229
Azure Functions
Functions are event driven. They run only in response to an event (called a "trigger"), such as receiving an HTTP request, or a message being added to a queue. You configure a trigger as part of the function definition. This approach simplifies your code by allowing you to declare where the data comes from (trigger/input binding) and where it goes (output binding). You don't need to write code to watch queues, blobs, hubs, and so on. You can focus purely on the business logic.




230
Power BI
When a query is evaluated with the Firewall on, the Firewall divides the query and all its dependencies into partitions (that is, groups of steps). Anytime one partition references something in another partition, the Firewall replaces the reference with a call to a special function called Value.Firewall.

233
Dataverse Queries
Filter Query
Definition: A part of the OData query that allows filtering of data based on specific conditions. In this case, filtering was used to select rows where ts_engagementid equals a certain GUID.
Example: $filter=ts_engagementid/Id eq {engagement_id}




234
Python
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so replacing the "var" function with "std" is the best approach.

You could calculate the square roots of the existing pivot table data, but this complicates the code.




235
Dataverse
Public Client:

Definition: An application type in OAuth2 that does not require a client secret because it runs on devices that cannot securely store credentials (like mobile or desktop apps).
Context: We configured your app as a public client so it could authenticate without a client secret




236
sklearn
It is possible and recommended to search the hyper-parameter space for the best cross validation score.

Any parameter provided when constructing an estimator may be optimized in this manner. Specifically, to find the names and current values for all parameters for a given estimator, use:

estimator.get_params()




237
Azure Pipelines

238
General
jq is a powerful command-line tool for parsing, filtering, and transforming JSON data. It allows you to navigate through JSON structures with ease using a simple and expressive query language.
To extract a specific field from a JSON object, you can use the . operator followed by the field name:

sh
jq '.fieldName' file.json

This command will output the value of fieldName from file.json.




239
Terraform
The graph output uses the DOT language, which is a machine-readable graph description language which originated in Graphviz. You can use the Graphviz dot command to present the resulting graph description as an image. There are also various third-party online graph rendering services which accept this format.

Python
The common practice is to use lists for homogeneous objects and tuples for heterogeneous objects. Lists are typically used when all elements are of the same type, while tuples are used when elements are of different types.




244
Azure Functions
A binding is a declarative way to connect data and services to your function.  Bindings interact with various data sources, which means you don't have to write the code in your function to connect to data sources and manage connections. The platform takes care of that complexity for you as a part of the binding code.

261
sklearn
Neighbors-based regression can be used in cases where the data labels are continuous rather than discrete variables. The basic idea is that if point A is very distant from point B, and point B is very close to point C, then we know that points A and C are very distant, without having to explicitly calculate their distance.




262
Python
One common way to customize a GET request is to pass values through query string parameters in the URL. To do this using get(), you pass data to params. For example, you can use GitHub’s repository search API to look for popular Python repositories:

import requests

# Search GitHub's repositories for popular Python projects
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.github.com/search/repositories",
    params={"q": "language:python", "sort": "stars", "order": "desc"},

Python
The first bit of information that you can gather from Response is the status code. A status code informs you of the status of the request.

For example, a 200 OK status means that your request was successful, whereas a 404 NOT FOUND status means that the resource you were looking for wasn’t found. There are many other possible status codes as well to give you specific insights into what happened with your request.

Python
Anytime the data that you’re trying to send or receive is sensitive, security is important. The way that you communicate with secure sites over HTTP is by establishing an encrypted connection using SSL, which means that verifying the target server’s SSL certificate is critical.  

The good news is that Requests does this for you by default. However, there are some cases where you might want to change this behavior. If you want to disable SSL certificate verification, then you pass False to the verify parameter of the request function:

Power BI
API Request Configuration in Power BI: When integrating the BLS Public Data API, you need the API endpoint URL, HTTP request type (GET or POST), and payload with series IDs, date ranges, and optional parameters. Requests for multiple series or additional features like calculations are often handled via POST requests with a JSON body.




335
Python
.headers returns a dictionary-like object, allowing you to access header values by key. For example, to see the content type of the response payload, you can access "Content-Type":

>>> response.headers["Content-Type"]
'application/json; charset=utf-8'

There’s something special about this dictionary-like headers object, though. The HTTP specification defines headers as case-insensitive, which means that you’re able to access these headers without worrying about their capitalization:

sklearn
Scikit-learn also provides the HalvingGridSearchCV and HalvingRandomSearchCV estimators that can be used to search a parameter space using successive halving [1] [2]. Successive halving (SH) is like a tournament among candidate parameter combinations. SH is an iterative selection process where all candidates (the parameter combinations) are evaluated with a small amount of resources at the first iteration.




346
Python
To customize headers, you pass a dictionary of HTTP headers to get() using the headers parameter. For example, you can change your previous search request to highlight matching search terms in the results by specifying the text-match media type in the Accept header:

import requests

response = requests.get(
    "https://api.github.com/search/repositories",
    params={"q": '"real python"'},
    headers={"Accept": "application/vnd.github.text-match+json"},
)
