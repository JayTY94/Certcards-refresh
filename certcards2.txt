DAX
KEEPFILTERS syntax is simple.

dax
CALCULATE(
  <expression>,
  KEEPFILTERS( <BooleanFilter1> [, <BooleanFilter2>, … ] )
)





12
DAX
KEEPFILTERS vs. ALL/REMOVEFILTERS (and other modifiers).
While ALL or REMOVEFILTERS clears filters, and ALLEXCEPT/ALLSELECTED clear selectively, KEEPFILTERS does the opposite—it retains existing filters and narrows them further.





13
DAX
KEEPFILTERS makes filters additive (intersecting) instead of replacing.
By default, CALCULATE(…, Column = Value) replaces any existing filter on Column. Wrapping that predicate in KEEPFILTERS forces DAX to intersect it with whatever filters are already in place.





14
DAX
KEEPFILTERS can outperform FILTER(...) for simple column predicates.
For straight column comparisons (e.g. Dim[Category] = "X"), KEEPFILTERS often lets the engine optimize better than wrapping a FILTER() over the entire table.





15
DAX
KEEPFILTERS supports multiple predicates.
You can pass several comma-separated Boolean tests into KEEPFILTERS, and each one will be intersected both with each other and with the external context.

Pandas
How can you apply multiple aggregation functions after resampling in Pandas?

You can apply functions like sum(), mean(), max(), etc., after resampling.

    Example:
df.resample('M').agg({'value': ['sum', 'mean']})





17
Pandas
Resampling changes the frequency of your time-series data.

Downsampling reduces the frequency (e.g., from daily to monthly).

    Example:
df.resample('M').sum()  # Downsample to monthly and sum values





18
Pandas
How can you fill missing values using interpolation in a time-series column?

Use .interpolate() to perform interpolation on missing values.

df.set_index(['category', 'sub_category'], inplace=True)





20
Pandas
How do you apply multiple aggregation functions (e.g., sum, mean) to different columns in a groupby operation?

Use .agg() with a dictionary to specify different aggregation functions for each column.

    Example:
df.groupby('category').agg({'value': ['sum', 'mean'], 'other_col': 'max'})

Logging in Python
Q: Why is it important to centralize logging configuration in large applications using Python's logging module?

A: Centralizing logging configuration ensures consistency, makes it easier to manage, and prevents scattered and conflicting logging setups across different modules.
This approach streamlines logging management and enhances maintainability.





27
Logging in Python
Q: What does the backupCount parameter do in RotatingFileHandler from the logging.handlers module?

A: It specifies the number of backup log files to keep after rotation, such as backupCount=5.
This limits the number of rotated files retained, managing disk space usage.





28
Logging in Python
Q: How can you prevent log messages from bubbling up to parent loggers in Python's logging module?

A: By setting propagate=False on the child logger.
This stops the log messages from being handled by ancestor loggers, ensuring they are processed only by the child logger's handlers.





29
Logging in Python
Q: What is one advantage of using dictConfig over fileConfig for logging configuration in Python's logging module?

A: dictConfig allows for more complex and dynamic configurations, often being easier to manage programmatically.
This flexibility makes it suitable for applications that require runtime logging configuration changes.





30
Logging in Python
Q: What is the impact of setting a logger's level higher than its handler's level in Python's logging module?

A: Log messages must meet or exceed the logger's level to be processed by the handler, regardless of the handler's own level.
This means that even if a handler is set to a lower level, it won't handle messages below the logger's threshold.





31

DAX
KEEPFILTERS is a modifier, not a standalone function.
You can only use KEEPFILTERS inside a filter argument of CALCULATE or CALCULATETABLE; it can’t wrap an entire table expression on its own.





120
DAX
KEEPFILTERS returns BLANK when there’s no overlap.
If your outer context excludes every value in your KEEPFILTERS set, the measure will come back blank—no rows remain after intersection.





121
DAX
KEEPFILTERS shines in part-to-whole calculations.
Use KEEPFILTERS when you need “this item’s sales ÷ its category’s sales”—it preserves the category filter while applying your item filter.





122
DAX
KEEPFILTERS protects nested security or business rules.
When you have an RLS or broad rule on a table, KEEPFILTERS ensures your measure’s extra restrictions don’t accidentally remove that outer rule.

    Example:
df.query('value > 10 and category == "A"')





125
Pandas
Upsampling increases the frequency (e.g., from monthly to daily).

You typically need to fill missing values, using methods like forward fill.

    Example:
df.resample('D').ffill()  # Up-sample to daily and forward fill missing values





126
Pandas
What does the unstack() function do in Pandas?

    Example:
df.groupby(['category', 'sub_category']).sum().unstack()





127
Pandas
How do you use apply() with a lambda function to transform a DataFrame?

apply() allows you to apply a function (including a lambda) to each row or column.

    Example:
df['new_column'] = df.apply(lambda row: row['A'] * 2 if row['B'] > 10 else row['A'], axis=1)

A log file generated by the FSLogix agent that provides detailed diagnostic information. It is crucial for troubleshooting issues related to mounting Profile Containers and other FSLogix operations.





348
FSLogix
When the local cache doesn't contain the data requested by the file system, Cloud Cache hydrates (reads and copies) the data from 1 of the remote storage providers to the local cache. This operation is also part of the sign in process when populating the local cache for the user's profile.





349
FSLogix
Data is written to all storage providers regardless of which provider is used during data hydration.
Performance (latency, utilization, bottlenecks) of a storage provider affects its sync status with the local copy.
Having one (1) or more provider that is behind in updates from local cache could be an indicator of an under performing storage provider.

JavaScript Concepts
If the addition operator + is used for primitive values and one operand is a string, the other one will be coerced into a string as well. The conversion logic is the same as when using the String function. Afterwards, the two strings are concatenated.

let name;
'hello ' + name;
// => 'hello undefined'

When ... appears on the left-hand side of an assignment, those three dots are known as the rest operator. The three dots together with a variable name is called a rest element. It collects zero or more values, and stores them into a single array.

    const [a, b, ...everythingElse] = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8];
    everythingElse;
    // => [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

  }
  const greeting = `Hello, ${getName()}!`;
  console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Jay!

Object Literals: The most common way to create an object is using object literals, which are a list of name-value pairs inside curly braces {}. For example:
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

The basic syntax for a string template in JavaScript uses backticks (`) and ${} for embedding expressions.
  const name = 'Jay';
  const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, Jay!

JavaScript Concepts
With Boolean(value) you can convert any value to a boolean. There is a fixed set of values, so called falsy values, that convert to false. Most importantly, false, 0, empty string, null, undefined and NaN are falsy.
Boolean(-1);// => true
Boolean(0);// => false
Boolean(' ');// => true
Boolean('');// => false





713
JavaScript Concepts
Bracket Notation: You can also use bracket notation, which is useful when the property name is dynamically determined.

const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
obj["key3"] = "value3"; // Adds key3 with value3





714
JavaScript Concepts
Object.assign(): This method can be used to copy the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

const obj = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" };
Object.assign(obj, { key3: "value3" }); // Adds key3 with value3

JavaScript's array destructuring syntax is a concise way to extract values from an array and assign them to distinct variables. In this example, each value in the numberOfMoons array is assigned to its corresponding planet:

    const numberOfMoons = [0, 2, 14];
    const [venus, mars, neptune] = numberOfMoons;

    neptune;
    // => 14

Front: How do you access the raw string content of a template literal?

Back: You can access the raw string content using the String.raw tag.
  const rawString = String.raw`Hello\nWorld`;
  console.log(rawString); // Output: Hello\nWorld





717
JavaScript Concepts
In JavaScript, you can only return exactly one value. If you want to pass more information, you need to combine it into one entity first, usually into an object, or an array.

function divide(a, b) {
  return {
    quotient: Math.floor(a / b),
    remainder: a % b,
  };
}





718
JavaScript Concepts
To create a deep copy of an object in JavaScript, you can use the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(object)) method. This approach works well for simple objects, such as those with string:number pairs, and ensures that the original object remains unmodified.

  }

JavaScript Concepts
In many cases, it makes sense to assign a more appropriate default value than undefined. This can be done by specifying default parameters directly in the function definition.

function someName(param1 = defaultValue1, param2 = defaultValue2) {
  // ...
}





721
JavaScript Concepts
When ... appears on the right-hand side of an assignment, it's known as the spread operator. It expands an array into a list of elements. Unlike the rest element, it can appear anywhere in an array literal expression, and there can be more than one.

    const oneToFive = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    const oneToTen = [...oneToFive, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    oneToTen;
    // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

JavaScript Concepts
Front: What are tagged templates and how do you use them?

Back: Tagged templates allow you to parse template literals with a function. The function receives the template string and the values as arguments.
  function tag(strings, ...values) {
  console.log(strings); // Array of string segments
  console.log(values);  // Array of values
  return 'Tagged template result';
}
const result = tag`Hello, ${name}!`;
console.log(result); // Output: Tagged template result
