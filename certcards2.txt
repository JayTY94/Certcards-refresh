Data type errors

Sometimes, when you import data into Power BI, the columns appear blank. This situation happens because of an error in interpreting the data type in Power BI. The resolution to this error is unique to the data source. For instance, if you're importing data from SQL Server and see blank columns, you could try to convert to the correct data type in the query.





24
Azure Pipelines
A stage can consist of many jobs, and each job can consume several resources. Before the execution of a stage can begin, all checks on all the resources used in that stage must be satisfied. Azure Pipelines pauses the execution of a pipeline prior to each stage, and waits for all pending checks to be completed.

Azure Analysis Services is available in Developer, Basic, and Standard tiers. Within each tier, plan costs vary according to processing power, Query Processing Units (QPUs), and memory size. When you create a server, you select a plan within a tier. You can change plans up or down within the same tier, or upgrade to a higher tier, but you can't downgrade from a higher tier to a lower tier.

Microsoft Data Analyst
All DirectQuery and Dual storage mode data sources must have the back-end server processing abilities to create a direct connection, which means that query folding is an automatic capability that you can use. If all transformations can be reduced to a single Select statement, then query folding can occur.

In Azure Analysis Services, the compatibility level refers to release-specific behaviors in the Analysis Services engine. For example, DirectQuery and tabular object metadata have different implementations depending on the compatibility level. In-general, you should choose the latest compatibility level supported by your platform.

It's good practice to change uncommon or unhelpful query names to names that are more obvious or that the user is more familiar with. For instance, if you import a view, the view might have a name that contains a prefix of v, such as vProduct. People might find this name unclear and confusing, so you might want to remove the prefix.

A progress bill is a credit against WIP. The progress bill amount appears on the client’s invoice but does not relieve any WIP. Instead, it adds to the client’s balance due. When you finally bill the client’s WIP, you will apply the progress amount against the WIP to reach the net balance due.

Occasionally, you might find that your data sources contain null values. For example, a freight amount on a sales order mgiht have a null value if it's synonymous with zero. If the value stays null, the averages will not calculate correctly. One solution would be to change the nulls to zero, which will produce the more accurate freight average.

Incorrect data types will prevent you from creating certain calculations, deriving hierarchies, or creating proper relationships with other tables. For example, if you try to calculate the Quantity of Orders YTD, you'll get the following error stating that the OrderDate column data type isn't Date, which is required in time-based calculations.




7
Microsoft Data Analyst
A best practice is to evaluate the column data types in Power Query Editor before you load the data into a Power BI data model. If you determine that a data type is incorrect, you can change it. You might also want to apply a format to the values in a column and change the summarization default for a column.

When you append queries, you'll be adding rows of data to another table or query. For example, you could have two tables, one with 300 rows and another with 100 rows, and when you append queries, you'll end up with 400 rows. When you merge queries, you'll be adding columns from one table (or query) into another. To merge two tables, you must have a column that is the key between the two tables.

Microsoft Data Analyst
On the Home tab on the Power Query Editor ribbon, select the drop-down list for Append Queries. You can select Append Queries as New, which means that the output of appending will result in a new query or table, or you can select Append Queries, which will add the rows from an existing table into another.

Profiling data is about studying the nuances of the data: determining anomalies, examining and developing the underlying data structures, and querying data statistics such as row counts, value distributions, minimum and maximum values, averages, and so on. 




13
Microsoft Data Analyst
Data anomalies are outliers within your data. Determining what those anomalies are can help you identify what the normal distribution of your data looks like and whether specific data points exist that you need to investigate further. Power Query Editor determines data anomalies by using the Column Distribution feature.






14
Microsoft Data Analyst
Select View on the ribbon, and under Data Preview, you can choose from a few options. To understand data anomalies and statistics, select the Column Distribution, Column Quality, and Column Profile options.




15
Microsoft Data Analyst
Column quality and Column distribution are shown in the graphs above the columns of data. Columns quality shows you the percentages of data that is valid, in error, or empty. In an ideal solution, you want 100 percent of the data to be valid.

1. What is a risk of having null values in a numeric column? 

That function SUM of data are incorrect.
That function MAX of data will be incorrect. 
That function AVERAGE of data will be incorrect.
  Correct. AVERAGE takes the total and divides by the number of non-null values. If NULL is synonymous with zero in the data, the average will be different from the accurate average.

An analytic query has three phases that are implemented in the following order:

Filter
Group
Summarize





4
Microsoft Data Analyst
In an Analytic Query, filtering, or slicing, targets the data of relevance. In Power BI reports, filters can be applied to three different scopes: the entire report, a specific page, or a specific visual. Filtering is also applied in the background when row-level security (RLS) is enforced.




5
Microsoft Data Analyst
In an Analytic Query, Summarizing produces a single value result. Typically, numeric columns are summarized by using summarization methods (sum, count, and many others). More complex summarizations, like a percent of grand total, can be achieved by defining measures that are written in DAX.

General
Fiscal years are commonly used by businesses, governments, and nonprofit organizations. They are used to keep track of financial performance, including revenue, expenses, and profits.





8
General
Some organizations use fiscal years for tax purposes. For example, the federal government's fiscal year runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. This means that when the government passes its annual budget, it is for the upcoming fiscal year, not the upcoming calendar year.
