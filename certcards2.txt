FSLogix
Data is written to all storage providers regardless of which provider is used during data hydration.
Performance (latency, utilization, bottlenecks) of a storage provider affects its sync status with the local copy.
Having one (1) or more provider that is behind in updates from local cache could be an indicator of an under performing storage provider.





347
FSLogix
Cloud Cache uses the locally mounted container to provide periodic updates to the remote storage providers. Cloud Cache is designed to insulate users from short-term or intermittent local (inner-region, close proximity) storage issues.





348
FSLogix
During a first-time sign-in, FSLogix creates the container for the user in C:\ProgramData\FSLogix\Cache and mounts the container to the virtual machine. Next, FSLogix sets up all the necessary redirections for the user's profile. Then the User Profile Service creates the user's profile into the local cache.





349
FSLogix
Q: How does FSLogix Profile Container enhance multi-session environments like Azure Virtual Desktop?
A: In multi-session environments, FSLogix Profile Containers ensure that user profiles are loaded quickly and consistently, regardless of which session or virtual machine the user logs into, ensuring a persistent and smooth experience even when multiple users share the same infrastructure.





350
FSLogix
Q: What is the maximum supported size of a VHDX file in FSLogix?
A: VHDX files can support up to 64 TB, making them suitable for large-scale enterprise environments where user profiles may require substantial storage capacity.





351
FSLogix
Cloud Cache uses the concept of a proxy file, represented as Profile_%username%.vhd though it isn't a true VHD file. The proxy file is used as a means to collect and process all I/O writes destined for the local cache. The I/O writes are buffered in memory and tracked via the proxy file before they're written out as block-level cache objects in the cache directory.





352
FSLogix
Q: What does the FSLogix Profile Container do when a user is logging into multiple Azure Virtual Desktops (AVD)?
A: FSLogix mounts the same Profile Container (VHDX) to any virtual desktop the user logs into, ensuring that their profile settings, documents, and application preferences are consistent and immediately available across all virtual machines. This provides a unified experience regardless of which VM the user accesses.





353
FSLogix
A full VHD(x) clone is performed when Cloud Cache determines, at sign in, that a storage provider isn't at the same sequence. During this operation, all pending writes are kept in the local cache until all storage providers are at the same sequence. Once complete, the flush operation begins sending new data to the storage providers.

545
FSLogix
Q: What happens to a FSLogix Profile Container when a user logs off?
A: When a user logs off, the changes made to the profile are saved back into the Profile Container (VHDX file), ensuring that all settings and data are retained for the next session.





546
FSLogix
Cloud Cache operates the user's profile from the local cache during the user's session and must be configured with one or more remote storage providers as specified in CCDLocations. These remote storage providers store copies of the local cache and are used during the current session and for subsequent sign ins.





547
FSLogix
During a user's session when the connection to any storage provider becomes unhealthy, FSLogix queues up all the changes and then flushes them to the providers when they return to a healthy state.
