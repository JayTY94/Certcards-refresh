TCP session hijacking is a technique that involves intercepting a TCP session initiated between two machines in order to hijack it. The initial authentication is performed by the legitimate machine. Later, the hacker who wishes to launch this attack takes control of the connection throughout the duration of the session.

One of the simplest and least expensive of the UPS is an offline or standby UPS. This is a UPS that is not normally enabled unless power is lost. If the UPS recognizes that the power source is gone, it will switch over to battery power. So there’s a short time frame between the time when power is lost and then power is made available from the UPS.

Confusion
Confusion means that each binary digit (bit) of the ciphertext should depend on several parts of the key, obscuring the connections between the two.[2]
The property of confusion hides the relationship between the ciphertext and the key.
Confusion increases the ambiguity of ciphertext and it is used by both block and stream ciphers.

SYN attacks exploit the TCP three-way handshake and overload the servers, resulting in authorized users being denied access to network resources. The attacker uses a spoofed IP address not in use on the Internet and sends multiple SYN packets to the target machine.

The kind of UPS that’s probably the most complex and the most expensive is the online, or what is called the double conversion, UPS. This UPS is always online and always providing power to your devices. And if the power does go out, there’s no switching process, because you’re already on battery power.

In an XML document or external entity, a CDATA section is a piece of element content that is marked up to be interpreted literally, as textual data, not as marked up content.[1] A CDATA section is merely an alternative syntax for expressing character data; there is no semantic difference between character data in a CDATA section and character data in standard syntax where, for example, "<" and "&" are represented by "&lt;" and "&amp;", respectively.

A power distribution unit (PDU) is a device fitted with multiple outputs designed to distribute electric power, especially to racks of computers and networking equipment located within a data center.[1] Data centers face challenges in power protection and management solutions. This is why many data centers rely on PDU monitoring to improve efficiency, uptime, and growth

A potentially unwanted program (PUP) or potentially unwanted application (PUA) is software that a user may perceive as unwanted or unnecessary. Companies often bundle a wanted program download with a wrapper application and may offer to install an unwanted application, and in some cases without providing a clear opt-out method. Antivirus companies define the software bundled as potentially unwanted programs[1][2]

A birthday attack is a type of cryptographic attack that exploits the mathematics behind the birthday problem in probability theory. This attack can be used to abuse communication between two or more parties. The attack depends on the higher likelihood of collisions found between random attack attempts and a fixed degree of permutations (pigeonholes).

Proprietorship/Sole Proprietorship 
Businesses with one single owner. Even though there is only one owner, the records of the owner's personal financial affairs are kept separate from those of the accounting records of the business. Separate tax returns are prepared for the business and for the individual.



4
Accounting
Conservatism Principle: WHenever two or more accounting practices appear to be equally suitable ot the transaction under consideration, the accountant should always choose the one that results in the lower or lowest Asset figure on the balance Sheet and the highest Expense on the Income Statement.





5
Accounting
Consistnecy: Practices and methods for presentation on the financial statements should be the same year to year and process to process. If for any reason the company and its accountants decide to change the method of presentation for any item, it must present a footnote explaining why the methods were changed.



6
Accounting
Entity Concept: The principle that requires separation of the transactions of each business or person from those of other organizations or individuals. For example, when a compnay is owned by one person, the personal finances of the individual who owns the company are not included on the company's financial statements.



7
Accounting
Going Concern Principle: THis principle assumes that ac company will continue in business into the future. Without this assumption, most of the accounting information could not be presented in the Financial Statements since we are alwasy amking assumptions (e.g. what the life of a Long-Term Asset is).



8
Accounting
Historical Cost Principle: According to this rule, most Assets and Liabilities should be represented on the Balance Sheet at the amount that was paid to acquire the Asset, or for the Liabilities, at the amount that was contracted to be paid in the future. No account is taken for either inflation or changing value of the Assets over time.



9
Accounting
Materiality Principle: This principle states that an item should only be included on the Balance aSheet if it would change any decisions of a statement user. For example, a multimillion dollar donating $100 to charity, this information would not change any decision that management or the owner would make. The expense should be recorded under "miscellaneous expense"

Accounting
Obtainable Information: Information reported in financial statements must be accessible in a timely manner without an unreasonable expenditure of resources—for example, time, effort, and money—to be included in the financial statements.





11
Accounting
Quantifiable Information: Information is easier to understand and use if it is quantified. However, when the information cannot be quantified but is still relevant to the users of the financial statements, it must be shown in the financial statements in narrative form in the footnotes.





12
Accounting
Realizable Value Principle: This indicates that Assets should normally not be shown on the Balance Sheet at a value greater than they can bring to the company if sold. If the original historical cost for example is $5,000, and the maximum that the company can sell that Asset for today is $4,000, this Asset should be shown on the Balance Sheet at the lower amount because of this principle.



13
Accounting
Recognition Principle: Revenue is recorded at the point of the transfer of the merchandise or service, and not at the point of receiving the cash. Once a service is provided for which a charge has been incurred, that service should be shown on the financial statements regardless of whether money has actually changed hands.





14
Accounting
Relevant Information: Information reported on financial statements must be relevant in that it helps statement users to estimate the value of a firm and/or evaluate the firm’s management. Not all information about a company is relevant to this decision-making process. 



15
Accounting
Stable-Monetary-Unit Concept: Even though the value of the dollar changes over time (due to inflation), the values that appear on the financial statements in the United States are normally presented at historical cost and do not take inflation into account.





16
Accounting
Understandable Information: Financial information must be comparable and consistent. If one accountant calls a particular item an Asset, the accountant must follow the set of rules known as generally accepted accounting principles to arrive at the definition of that Asset. 



17
Accounting
Verifiable Information: Information on the financial statements must be based on sufficient evidence that can be substantiated and provides a reliable basis for evaluating the firm and its management.
